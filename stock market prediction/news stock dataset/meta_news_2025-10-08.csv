META,Why Jim Cramer thinks the stock market isn't loved,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-jim-cramer-thinks-the-stock-market-isnt-loved-125154580.html,2025-10-08,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid Unfiltered onApple Podcasts,Amazon Music,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. While Warren Buffettsaid,“our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes? Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" hostJim Cramertold Yahoo Finance'sBrian Sozzion a new episode of theOpening Bid Unfilteredpodcast (see video above; listen below). “I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.” Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL). Save the date for Yahoo Finance's BIG Invest event! “FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.” For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.” This shorter-term thinking contrasts withBuffett’s sentimenton the stock market. He oncesaid, “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.” Read more:How do millionaires make their money​?

Impatience and skittishness are only two obstacles, according to Cramer. “The market got a bad rap because it seemed to be the playground of billionaires,” he said. “It got to be the image of the filthy rich, and the billionaires don’t help.” “I don’t want it to be a playground at all,” he added. “I want it to be the school for people to get rich as they did when they bought Nvidia.” Grace Williamsis a writer for Yahoo Finance.

META,Should You Buy the Rebound in AppLovin Stock Today?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-rebound-applovin-stock-today-204738764.html,2025-10-08,"AppLovin (APP) stock has been rather volatile in recent sessions after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an investigation into the California-based ad-tech company. The probe centers on allegations that AppLovin violated service agreements with platform partners regarding data collection practices, specially examining whether the company improperly collected user identification data from major platforms like Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, and Google. This Crypto and AI Stock Just Got a Massive New Street-High Price Target That Implies Shares Could Double in the Next Year If You Love Dividends, Here Are 3 High-Yield Stocks to Buy Now AMD Is Soaring on an OpenAI Deal. Is AMD Stock a Better Buy Than Nvidia Here? Get exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Following an initial SEC-driven decline, AppLovin shares recovered significantly on Tuesday and are currently up some 215% versus their year-to-date low in early April. Investors should consider buying the dip in APP stock today mostly because the firm’s fundamental business performance remains remarkably strong. AppLovin’s transformation from a mobile gaming app company into an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled ad-tech leader has been particularly successful, with its AXON 2.0 optimization engine serving as a major growth catalyst. Financial metrics support this success story, with the company maintaining robust fundamentals including a 33.35% profit margin and annual revenue of $4.7 billion. Its latest quarterly results demonstrate continued momentum with revenue increasing 77% year-over-year to $1.26 billion and net income soaring 164% to $820 million, further strengthening the case for owning AppLovin stock. AppLovin's expansion beyond mobile gaming into e-commerce advertising represents a significant growth opportunity, with the potential market estimated to be 20 times larger than its current focus. Another major reason to stick with APP shares for the longer term is its recent addition to the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) which further validates the firm’s market position and could drive institutional capital to it. In a recent interview withCNBC, Needham analyst Bernie McTernan also cited these tailwinds to assert that AppLovin stock is “rightfully” trading at a premium. McTernan is bullish on the company’s latest launch of its self-service platform and believes APP stock will follow a similar trajectory as TikTok that “went from a billion to two billion to five billion to nine billion.” Wall Street more broadly remains bullish on AppLovin stock as well. The consensus rating on APP shares currently sits at “Strong Buy” with price targets going as high as $860, indicating potential upside of nearly 35% from here.

META,The Chart’s Flashing a New Warning: META Stock Could Tumble to $500 From Here,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chart-flashing-warning-meta-stock-183451250.html,2025-10-08,"Someone forgot to tell Meta Platforms (META) it’s an AI stock. Because while many of its peers are rallying in early October, the social media giant we know for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, not to mention those cool new goggles and glasses, is pointing in a different direction. Downward. This Crypto and AI Stock Just Got a Massive New Street-High Price Target That Implies Shares Could Double in the Next Year If You Love Dividends, Here Are 3 High-Yield Stocks to Buy Now AMD Is Soaring on an OpenAI Deal. Is AMD Stock a Better Buy Than Nvidia Here? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! META has been one of the best-performing stocks in the world since it went public in 2012, so this is merely a flesh wound to long-term shareholders. However, when a stock’s price history includes plunging from $385 to nearly $300 lower ($88) in just over a year from 2021 to 2022, and with the memories of its loss of roughly one-third its share price in a matter of weeks earlier this year, risk management is not an idle topic. I have a two-part rule that guides everything I do as an investor, and always has: Any stock can go up any time, for any reason The RISK attached to any particular stock is what separates investments I want to make versus those I steer clear of. META to me appears to be in transition from “not bad” to “be very careful.” Here’s the daily chart, which shows the 20-day moving average starting to tank. That’s the first thing that typically hits my radar, beyond the general shape of the chart itself. That $700 price area, about 2% below Monday’s close, is a possible landing spot for the stock. Indeed, it traded down to $690 intraday. And there’s a round number at the top of META’s price history too, as it topped out just below $800 in mid-August. But at the margin, I see a new risk of that soft support breaking just below Monday’s low, which could instantly bring that 2025 low into play. That’s way down at $500. The weekly look below only adds to my concerns with this stock, at least technically. The 20-week moving average (in red) is in the process of rolling over, and the 50-week (green line) is just hanging on. More significantly, that Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) indicator is tenuous at best. It is hard to deny that there’s selling pressure underway here. Earnings are about three weeks away, so there’s a lot of time for the stock to fade into that event, before the market gets to react to another fresh quarterly report from Mark Zuckerberg’s company. META sells at 26x trailing earnings, not outrageous in today’s market. But I can’t say the same about that 11x sales figure. Returning to the technical picture for META, I note that while the stock is a “Buy” using Barchart’s 13-part Barchart Opinion indicator which covers three separate time frames, that 24% mark you see at left in green is lower than it was a week ago. And that latter mark is lower than a month ago. In my experience with this system, that’s not a good sign. It is also why ratings like “buy” and “sell” always need more explanation and context, as you see below. I’m not much of a “seasonality” investor, but I will note that META’s worst month historically is October. And by a noticeable margin. Wall Street analysts like the stock, even if I don’t. But really, are there many stocks Wall Street doesn’t like after a move like META has had? To say that group are bandwagon-jumpers puts it mildly. Stocks like META have had a “halo effect” for a long time. They are the quintessential buy-the-dip candidates for so many types of investors, including the powerful algorithms that have such influence on daily trading now. But while you can never count out an iconic stock like this one, I conclude it is more risk than is worth it at this moment.

We are thrilled to formalize this collaboration and work alongside industry leaders to accelerate innovation for the next generation of applications.""– Mike Grabowski, CTO & Founder, Callstack ""React has been the wind pushing forward application UIs – and the way that we build them – for the last decade. Both because of the core ideas – components that are composable and that are always up to date – and also because of the tasteful way that the maintainers have evolved React over that time, for example the elegant transition from class components to function components. Now that almost everyone uses React – and even those who don't are now using frameworks inspired by it! – it's wonderful that React will have its own foundation as Meta brings in the entire community to guide its future. It's a great honor for Expo to be a founding board member and expand our work of stewardship for this absolutely electric idea.""– Charlie Cheever, Co-founder, Expo We are excited to join the React Foundation as a founding member.

""Twelve years ago, we took a chance with React Native – and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful bets we've ever made. Ever since then, we've been actively supporting the ecosystem by building and maintaining core libraries and fostering community relations. At the same time, we've been successfully using React Native to ship hundreds of apps for our clients. Having witnessed how this technology has grown and how impactful it has become, we're proud to join the React Foundation as founding members.

META,"Bitcoin ‘Severely Undervalued’ vs Gold, Says Lightspark CEO as Tokenized Gold Hits $3B",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-severely-undervalued-vs-gold-173347007.html,2025-10-08,"Lightspark CEO David Marcus claimed thatBitcoinremains “severely undervalued” compared to gold, suggesting the cryptocurrency could reach $1.3 million if it matched gold’s market capitalization. “I still feel Bitcoin is severely undervalued, especially if you compare it to gold,”Marcus said during a Monday interview with Bloomberg, adding that Bitcoin would trade at $1.3 million per coin at gold parity. The statement came as Bitcoin touched a fresh all-time high above $126,000 on October 7, while tokenized gold assets simultaneously crossed the $3 billion market cap threshold for the first time. Marcus, who previously ledMeta’s failed Libra cryptocurrency project, argued that Bitcoin’s utility as a neutral settlement asset for global payments has not been priced into current valuations. Lightspark CEO David Marcus | Source: Bloomberg The Lightspark founder emphasized Bitcoin’s role as foundational infrastructure during the interview, comparing it to the internet’s architecture. “Bitcoin is the internet of money,”Marcus stated, explaining that his company bought Bitcoin three years ago to facilitate transactions and support stablecoins on the network. Marcus acknowledged the improved regulatory conditions under the Trump administration compared to previous years, when roadblocks had stifled innovation across the crypto industry. He noted that major financial institutions are now embracing Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds, which could be seen as the beginning of an irreversible shift towards mainstream adoption. “The horse has left the barn,”Marcus said, describing Bitcoin as the most accepted and trusted digital asset globally. His firm entered Bitcoin during the previous bear market, giving Lightspark an advantageous cost basis as the asset climbed nearly 100% over the past year. Lightspark specializes in building technologies on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, allowing faster and cheaper cross-border payments compared to traditional alternatives. Marcus described his company’s work facilitating peso transfers to Mexico 24/7 at a cost below conventional remittance services as an example of Bitcoin’s practical applications. The tokenized gold market reached $3.03 billion in capitalization on Tuesday as physical gold briefly topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time ever. Gold Coins Market Cap | Source: CoinGecko PAX Gold and Tether Gold dominate the sector, with each token trading just below $4,000 and closely tracking spot gold prices. Trading volume for gold-backed tokens spiked to $640 million over 24 hours as the precious metal rallied alongside silver, which jumped past $48.50. The surge occurred during the sixth day of the U.S. government shutdown, which contributed to renewed investor interest in traditional safe havens. Bitcoin’s current price represents a ratio of roughly 31.6 ounces of gold per coin, down from a peak of over 40 ounces in December 2024. The declining ratio suggests gold has outperformed Bitcoin in recent months despite the cryptocurrency’s 30% year-to-date gain. VanEck’s Matthew Sigel separately argued on Tuesday thatBitcoin could reach $644,000 per coinif it captured half of gold’s store-of-value market at current prices. “Surveys show younger consumers in emerging markets increasingly prefer Bitcoin,”Sigel wrote on X, noting that roughly half of gold’s market value stems from its store-of-value role rather than industrial or jewelry demand. VanEck’s broader research projects that Bitcoin could settle 10% of global trade by 2050, potentially supporting a long-term price of $2.9 million per coin. The research also estimates that central banks would hold approximately 2.5% of their reserves in Bitcoin under such a scenario. Deutsche Bank analysts predictedin September that Bitcoin could join gold on central bank balance sheets by 2030, citing the Trump administration’s strategic Bitcoin reserve initiative. The growing Bitcoin edge over gold for institutional investors comes asspot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.24 billion in net inflowslast week, their second-highest tally since launch. Centralized exchanges now hold just 2.83 million Bitcoin, the lowest level in six years, intensifying supply constraints as demand accelerates. The Bitcoin-to-gold comparison has sharpened this year as both assets set records amid mounting concerns over currency debasement and fiscal uncertainty in major economies.

META,Reddit vs. Meta: Which Social Media Giant Stock Is the Better Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-vs-meta-social-media-171700768.html,2025-10-08,"RedditRDDT andMeta PlatformsMETA are leading social media platforms that monetize user engagement through digital advertising. While RDDT is an emerging social media platform, gaining traction with community-driven advertising, Meta leads the broader social networking space through platforms like Facebook and Instagram.Per the Grand View Research report, the global digital advertising market size was valued at $488.4 million in 2024 and is expected to reach $1,164.25 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 15.4% from 2025 to 2030. Both Reddit and META are expected to benefit from this rapid growth pace.RDDT or META — Which of these Social Media Giant stocks has the greater upside potential? Let’s find out. Reddit is benefiting from strong growth in user engagement, including rising daily and weekly active users, ARPU gains, and the expansion of advertiser tools such as Dynamic Product Ads, Reddit Pixel and Conversion API.In the second quarter of 2025, Reddit’s advertising revenue increased 84% year over year to $465 million, driven by both existing advertisers deepening their investments and a 50% rise in the active advertiser count.  This growth highlights Reddit’s ability to attract advertisers across large, mid-market and small-to-medium-sized businesses.The company’s focus on automation and usability is another driver of its advertising success. The platform has integrated tools like Smartly, which combines Reddit’s audience and performance data with AI-powered advertising capabilities, making it easier for advertisers to launch, scale and optimize campaigns.RDDT’s expanding portfolio has been noteworthy. The company recently announced the launch of new Reddit Pro tools for publishers. These tools include article insights, RSS auto-import, and AI-powered community recommendations, all of which are currently in beta testing. The platform also introduced a better in-app link viewing experience. This change makes it easier for users to read articles and join conversations directly on Reddit. Meta Platforms’ focus on integrating AI into its platforms, which include Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger, and Threads, is driving user engagement to boost ad revenues.In the second quarter of 2025, Advertising revenues increased 21.5% year over year to $46.56 billion, accounting for 98% of second-quarter revenues. At cc, revenues increased 22% year over year.The company’s AI-powered ad recommendation models have improved efficiency and performance, driving approximately 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. Improvements in AI-powered recommendation systems have led to a 5% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram in the second quarter of 2025.Meta Platforms is also seeing an increase in the usage of its AI creative tools. AI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove, driven by its more than 3.48 billion daily users. Meta AI usage continues to increase, which is now available in more than 200 countries and territories. In the year-to-date period, shares of Reddit and Meta Platforms have rallied 24.6% and 22.3%, respectively. The outperformance in Reddit can be attributed to strong ad revenue growth, driven by improved targeting, performance tools, global expansion, and increased engagement through search-led initiatives, such as Reddit Answers.Despite a robust portfolio and clientele, META is facing challenging macroeconomic conditions, including tariff uncertainties, which do not bode well for Meta Platforms’ advertising business. Higher tariffs are expected to hurt digital ad spending. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Valuation-wise, RDDT and META shares are currently overvalued, as suggested by a Value Score of F and C, respectively.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales, RDDT shares are trading at 14.79X, which is higher than META’s 8.18X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RDDT’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $1.82 per share, which has increased by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating a 154.65% year-over-year rise.

Quote The Zacks Consensus Estimate for META’s 2025 earnings is pegged at $28.14 per share, which has increased by a penny over the past 30 days, indicating a 17.94% increase year over year. Meta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote RDDT and META’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters. However, RDDT’s average surprise of 261.89% is higher than META’s surprise of 20.47%. While both Reddit and Meta Platforms stand to benefit from the booming digital advertising market, Reddit offers greater upside potential given its rapid revenue growth, surging advertiser base, and expanding engagement tools.META now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the world's largest AI services. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern. Stiff competition also remains a headwind.Currently, Reddit sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), making the stock a stronger pick than Meta Platforms, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

META,"Anthropic plans to open India office, eyes tie-up with billionaire Ambani",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-plans-open-india-office-162715425.html,2025-10-08,"Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei is in India this week, with plans to set up an office in Bengaluru and explore a partnership with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, TechCrunch has learned. The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S. Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said. India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, withmore than a billion internet subscribers— has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firmSimilarweb. In August, Reliance Industriespartnered with major technology companies, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025. That Reliance-OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip. Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment. Alongside Mumbai, Amodei is visiting New Delhi to meet top lawmakers and senior federal government officials, sources said. He is also expected to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two people familiar with his trip plans told TechCrunch. Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings. Anthropic’s Claude app, available on iOS and Android, recorded a 48% year-over-year increase in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs this year, according to Appfigures. Consumer spending on the app in India surged 572% year-over-year, generating $195,000 in September alone, the data showed. The India figures, however, remain modest compared with those in the United States, where downloads rose 91% year-over-year and consumer spending jumped 604%. U.S. users spent $2.5 million on the Claude app in September, per Appfigures. Globally, the app saw 74% growth in downloads to 1.01 million and a 546% rise in consumer spending to $5.62 million in the same month. Unlike OpenAI, which aims to establish a sales and marketing setup while overseeing policy updates from New Delhi, Anthropic plans to target developers and startups with its office in Bengaluru. Anthropic is seeing its largest usage coming from India, a founder who works closely with the AI company told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity.

META,Open Compute Project Foundation and iMasons Develop Taxonomy for Carbon Disclosure,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-compute-project-foundation-imasons-154500095.html,2025-10-08,"New Specification for Embodied Carbon Harmonizes Reporting Across the DC Industry AUSTIN, Texas,Oct. 7, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- The Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), in collaboration with the iMasons Climate Accord (iCA), today unveiled theEmbodied Carbon Disclosure – OCP Base Specification, with contributions from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Schneider Electric and more, the first major work product from their alliance. This foundational specification establishes a common, open framework for reporting data center equipment carbon impact data. This framework is designed to reduce duplication, align reporting practices, and streamline carbon disclosure for both buyers and suppliers in the digital infrastructure ecosystem. Leveraging OCP's Community and OCP's ecosystems ability to impact the data center supply chain and iMasons reach with the end user community, this work is a crucial step in tackling one of the industry's greatest challenges, creating sustainable, and scalable digital infrastructure capable of meeting the requirements for AI and HPC from the data center to the edge. This specification directly responds to the industry's need for consistent, transparent carbon reporting. By harmonizing carbon disclosure requirements across stakeholders and eliminating duplicative data requests, the specification and provided template simplifies information sharing, accelerates supplier compliance, and empowers buyers with clear carbon insights that can be used to make a purchasing decision. A standard taxonomy for supplier carbon disclosures related to data center materials and equipment provides the industry an opportunity to build new tools and utilize existing sustainability solutions with a common data structure for reporting carbon impact and methodology applied to derive the result. ""The large AI data center buildout and expansion worldwide in front of us has the potential to have an enormous impact on our environment. The OCP Community is committed to ensure that any potential negative impacts are minimized. It was with this as a guiding factor that OCP established an alliance with iMasons Climate Accord, and are very pleased to see the initial fruits of the effort materialize. This new open carbon disclosure framework gives our members and the data center ecosystem a trusted, community-led standardized data carbon reporting format they need to make sustainability a central part of their purchasing and product development decisions,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation. The longer term goal of this effort between the Open Compute Project and iMasons is to be a catalyst to the industry to better build capabilities toward standardized carbon disclosure methodologies with increased rigor and stricter requirements for high quality carbon measurement practices. The current base specification is a step in this direction encouraging vendors to disclose the embodied carbon figure for a specific piece of data center infrastructure equipment (MEP - Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing or IT - Information Technology) or material stream, as well as the underlying methodologies and data sources that were used to calculate that carbon figure. The specification is purposely flexible to allow a variety of carbon measurement tools, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), CIBSE's TM65 methodology, Product Carbon Footprint, or Economic Input-Output modeling. As the supplier community builds capabilities around carbon measurement, this specification will help procurement organizations to uncover and evaluate the types and quality of empirical data that their suppliers are using to quantify the carbon impact of their products. ""At iMasons, we believe that uniting the industry around open, transparent standards is the only way to achieve meaningful progress on sustainability. This collaboration with OCP is a major step forward in giving our respective communities — from suppliers to end users — the clarity and confidence to make carbon-aware decisions. By aligning on a common framework, we are not only reducing complexity, but also creating the foundation for scalable, sustainable digital infrastructure that can responsibly power the AI era,"" said Santiago Suinaga, CEO Infrastructure Masons. ""Critical to the success of this effort is the well-established multi-vendor data center supply chain provided by the OCP vendor member community. Upon delivering an open framework such as this new specification along with a set of best practices, the OCP members typically move rapidly to adopt and align their product offerings. As the catalog of products produced with embodied carbon disclosure information for showcase in the OCP Marketplace increases, end user demand is stimulated for products that comply, "" said Rob Coyle, Director of Technical Programs at the Open Compute Project Foundation. The OCP and iMasons Communities will begin leveraging the potential of the Embodied Carbon Disclosure Specification. Later this year, the Carbon Disclosure Ready™product recognition icon will begin to appear in the OCP Marketplace alongside products where carbon reporting is available. This identification will help buyers easily recognize products with carbon reporting that complies with the OCP Embodied Carbon Disclosure Specification. ""This effort between the Open Compute Project and the iMasons Climate Accord comes at a time when the data center industry is undergoing tremendous change, providing an ideal time for introducing new buying behaviours. Tackling a very important problem, the carbon impact of data center equipment by providing a common format for reporting carbon content with an eye to evolving a standard carbon reporting methodology is a necessary and simple 1st step that the industry can take together. Once we have a foundation established to compare carbon content reporting across the industry we can believe this will lead to better decision making and accountability."" said Ashish Nadkarni Group VP and GM of Worldwide Infrastructure Research at IDC.

AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) is one of the worst performers on Monday. AppLovin dropped for a fourth consecutive day on Monday, losing 14.03 percent to end at $587 apiece after it triggered an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look into its data collection practices. A report by Bloomberg, citing people privy to the matte,r said that the SEC is looking into allegations that AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) violated service agreements with its platform partners to deliver more targeted advertising to consumers.

META,Will the $14.2B Meta Deal Give CoreWeave an Edge Over Competitors?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-2b-meta-deal-coreweave-132000678.html,2025-10-08,"CoreWeave’s CRWV position in the rapidly growing AI infrastructure market is likely to get a boost following its recent deal withMeta PlatformsMETA. Under the partnership, CRWV will supply META with cloud computing capacity. Depending on certain conditions, Meta will initially pay up to $14.2 billion through Dec. 14, 2031, with an option to expand significantly through 2032 for more cloud capacity. This deal indicates increasing confidence in emerging AI infrastructure providers like CoreWeave, beyond established players such as Amazon Web Services andMicrosoft’s MSFT Azure. The META deal comes after the recent OpenAI contract expansion. The new contract, worth $6.5 billion, involves CRWV supplying capacity for OpenAI training of its next-generation models. The total value of OpenAI contact now stands at an impressive $22.4 billion, which includes $11.9 billion agreement in March and $4 billion expansion in May. The contracts with META and OpenAI (which is a leading AI company) not only enhance revenue visibility for CRWV but also validate its AI infrastructure as cutting-edge and reliable. Moreover, collaboration with NVIDIA is another positive aspect. CRWV’s cloud services are also optimized for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale systems. Additionally, the company deployed NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and HGX B200 systems at scale, integrated into its “Mission Control” for enhanced reliability and performance. NVIDIA also has an agreement with CRWV to purchase residual unsold capacity through April 13, 2032, subject to certain conditions. However, the road to market dominance would not be easy, given that the incumbents in this space still command vast financial resources. There is also fierce competition from upcoming players likeNebiusNBIS, which CoreWeave needs to watch out for. Another challenge will be scaling efficiently without compromising profitability and margins. Nonetheless, these various contracts mark a pivotal moment for CRWV, but maintaining this momentum will require disciplined execution, prudent capex management and continued innovation amid rising competition. Nebius, while smaller in scale, has emerged as an intriguing challenger to CoreWeave. NBIS is also experiencing hypergrowth with revenues surging 625% year over year to $105.1 million in the second quarter of 2025. AI cloud infrastructure revenues grew more than nine times year over year, driven by demand for copper GPUs and near-peak GPU utilization. Explosive revenue growth demonstrates Nebius’ ability to capture demand in a rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. With the new Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and its data center capacity expanding significantly in parallel, the company expects a substantial increase in sales by year-end. Moreover, NBIS recently closed a deal with Microsoft for $17.4 billion, which involves it providing dedicated GPU capacity to the latter from the new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year through 2031. Microsoft could also purchase extra services or capacity as per the terms of the deal, which would raise the total value to around $19.4 billion. Microsoft is a giant in this space, with Azure Cloud being one of the dominant forces in the AI-cloud infrastructure space. Microsoft has altered every Azure region into an AI-first environment with liquid cooling capabilities, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI infrastructure wave. Over the past year, the company has added more than 2 GW of new data center capacity. Now it has more than 400 data centers across 70 regions. The company is allocating significant capital expenditures to scale its AI infrastructure. MSFT is planning more than $30 billion in capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 alone. It had a massive backlog of $368 billion across Microsoft Cloud at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. Shares of CoreWeave have gained 43.1% over the past month compared with the Internet Software industry’s decline of 2%.

META,"Reform treasurer’s company seeking millions after alleged fraud, High Court told",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reform-treasurer-company-seeking-millions-120932514.html,2025-10-08,"Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy’s company is seeking millions in damages from a technology start-up which claimed to be the “next Facebook” following a “clear and straightforward case of fraud”, the High Court has been told. Candy Ventures Sarl (CVS), a portfolio of companies founded by Mr Candy, is taking legal action against Dutch businessman Robert Bonnier over allegations he “lied” to “deceive” it into investing around 7.5 million euro (£6.5 million) in Aaqua BV, which he directs. Mr Candy, who was announced as Reform’s treasurer in December last year, owns 90% of CVS. Barristers for the company told a trial on Tuesday that Mr Bonnier claimed Apple and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) were set to invest one billion US dollars in Aaqua, and as a result, CVS swapped shares in podcasting firm Audioboom for “worthless” shares in Aaqua. It is asking a court to rescind the investment or order Mr Bonnier and Aaqua to pay £5.7 million in damages. Mr Bonnier is representing himself at trial and in August was blocked from defending the claim for breaching court orders, with barristers for CVS telling the court he was “restricted to attendance and making oral submissions” and was “not allowed to advance any factual case”. He has told the court that while he “overstated the prospects of an investment” into Aaqua, he did not believe CVS would “rely” on it. In written submissions for the trial in London, Jonathan Nash KC, for CVS, said: “In late 2020/early 2021, Mr Bonnier lied to CVS, time and again, both orally and in writing, to deceive it into investing in his company, Aaqua. “He told CVS that he had discussed Aaqua with two of the world’s biggest names, Apple and LVMH, and believed that they would invest in the company.” He continued: “In fact, and as Mr Bonnier well knew, none of that was true.” He added: “As a result of his flagrant fraud, CVS, like other sophisticated investors, was duped into investing in Aaqua.” Mr Nash told the court Aaqua, which is now insolvent, was established in the Netherlands in 2020 to develop a “new social media software application”. Mr Bonnier is claimed to have told Mr Candy and Steven Smith, CVS’s executive director, that Apple and LVMH were set to invest in Aaqua, which Mr Smith told the court was “completely fundamental” to CVS’s decision to invest. Mr Candy met Mr Bonnier in Dubai in January 2021. Mr Nash claimed Mr Bonnier said he personally knew Apple chief executive Tim Cook and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and told Mr Smith that Aaqua would be the “next Facebook”. CVS agreed in February 2021 to transfer 1.5 million shares in podcasting firm Audioboom to Aaqua, worth around £6.5 million. It also agreed to purchase 15,000 Aaqua shares, which were believed to be worth around 7.5 million euro (£6.5 million), but Mr Nash said the value of these was “false and artificial, induced, as it was, by Aaqua and Mr Bonnier’s fraud”. Following this, Mr Bonnier told Mr Candy on WhatsApp that Apple’s investment was “a foregone conclusion”, but the investment never occurred, Mr Nash said. Mr Nash said by the summer of 2022, “CVS’s patience had run out”, and when Mr Smith asked Mr Bonnier about the situation, he responded that he was “simply no longer comfortable talking about founder partner relationships”, with legal proceedings being launched that year. The barrister said Mr Bonnier had since said he had only met Mr Cook once, in 1999, and only met Mr Arnault at “large social gatherings”, adding Mr Bonnier knew his claims were false and “intended to mislead” CVS. The court was told Mr Bonnier claims he did not believe that Apple and LVMH’s supposed investment caused CVS to invest, which Mr Nash denied. Mr Nash said in court that Mr Bonnier claims he did not say Apple and LVMH were involved, and “all he did was express his aspiration that he could get Apple and LVMH on board”. But the barrister said the businessman “went much further than that”, stating: “What was said and what was said dishonestly, and what was highly material to my client’s view of this investment, was that there were active discussions with Apple and LVMH which could reasonably be expected to lead to investment.” In written submissions, Mr Bonnier admitted “selling his aspirations for Aaqua very enthusiastically, and occasionally perhaps going too far in those efforts”. But he said he had a “proven track record of ‘pulling off the impossible’ and creating substantial value for shareholders”. He said: “However, it was always understood that ultimately the claimant would form their own independent views on whether the founder’s vision would be achieved.” The Dutchman also said CVS had “expressly stated and agreed that it would conduct its own diligence on the specific point of the likelihood of an investment” by Apple and LVMH. He continued: “The claimant suffered no loss as a result of its investment; any loss it did suffer was brought about by the claimant’s own actions.” The trial before Mr Justice Bright is set to conclude later this week."
META,"The public company isn’t dead, it’s misunderstood",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/public-company-isn-t-dead-130000325.html,2025-10-08,"Record levels of private capital and the recent and rapid rise of VC-funded unicorns suggest to some that public markets are a thing of the past, a holdover from the capitalism of yesteryear. Financial news of the past two decades is littered with stories of companies delaying IPOs and growing despite it —Meta, Uber,Airbnband the like. Some still remain private, most notably Elon Musk’sSpaceX. If they can find success without going public, why should anyone else? Take the example of Klarna — a 20-year-old company — which recently had a successful IPO on the NYSE, with a nice pop on its first day. Why would a company like Klarna choose to go public? Public companies have to deal with public investors, follow specific rules on governance, and disclose extensive information. Klarna had no trouble accessing private capital in the past. Surely some of their original backers were looking for liquidity, but there is plenty of private liquidity around if that is all they need. Many companies have decided that the private markets are a better place to be. Over the last couple of decades, the number of listed companies and new IPOs in developed markets has dropped dramatically. The rigor and scrutiny of being publicly traded, and the perceived pressures that come with opening up the shareholder roll, are burdens many companies would prefer to avoid. So why go public? The answer is that there are great benefits to being a listed company in a deep, global market. While there are plenty of capital options besides going public, public markets help companies grow up. That discipline and credibility, as well as the opportunity for founders, employees, and investors to benefit from the value created, still make public markets the destination of choice. And while listings did indeed drop over the past 30 or so years, in that same timeframe, global public market capitalization rose to over $90 trillion, or about 112% of global GDP. Public markets aren’t dead — they’re just misunderstood. The idea that companies must choose between the quarterly spin cycle and the refuge of private markets is a myth. With the right strategy and the right investors, public companies still deliver superior long-term value. It’s true, public companies spend a lot of time on the quarter — hitting or missing targets, talking to the Street, etc. But the reality is that providing estimates of your next quarter’s earnings only encourages traders to make short-term bets and increases the volatility of your stock price. It’s a habit, not a requirement. The best companies recognize that such a myopic focus on the quarterly cycle is a distraction from building a great business. To avoid it, most companies don’t issue quarterly earnings guidance anymore; by 2024, only 21% of S&P 500 companies were still doing so, down from 36% in 2010. Public companies have plenty of opportunities to talk to the investment community. But “investors” are not a monolith, something many CEOs find out too late. They have different horizons and incentives; some are seeking durable returns over decades, while others are simply looking for alpha. This is not criticism. It’s reality. But evidence shows that an increase in short-term, transient investors is associated with cuts to long-term investments (R&D, marketing, etc.) in order to increase short-term earnings, leading to temporary boosts in equity valuations that reverse over time. While CEOs can’t bar investors from buying stock in the public markets, they can have an investor strategy that tries to attract the best long-term investors by understanding their time frames and incentives. Companies that find success in this regard employ several key tactics: they engage consistently with large shareholders throughout the year (rather than limiting interactions to AGM seasons). They deploy CEO and board-level leadership for key shareholder meetings and, importantly, align IR professional incentives with long-term shareholder success metrics rather than short-term sell-side ratings. This comprehensive approach reduces an emphasis on 90-day cycles, creates deeper shareholder support, and unlocks mutual value for both investors and public companies. To be sure, there are advantages to staying private for companies in certain circumstances. But public markets remain an unmatched source of capital, credibility, and the opportunity to scale. It’s time to stop viewing them as a necessary evil and instead as a strategic asset — as long as companies can navigate them with intent and with the right strategies in place. Public companies aren’t dying, but CEOs who don’t adapt their investor strategy will.
