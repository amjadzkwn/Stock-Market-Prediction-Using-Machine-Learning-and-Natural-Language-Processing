AMZN,What's driving the latest bout of AI deals? Analyst answers.,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-driving-latest-bout-ai-213000938.html,2025-10-08,"Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Futurum CEO Daniel Newman discuss the AI milestones that could push Big Tech companies and hyperscalers even farther, includingmeeting compute capacity and demands, amid the latest round ofartificial intelligence deals and partnerships. Also catch Daniel Newman and Patrick Moorhead weigh in onwhether bubbles are forming in the AI trade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat? Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them. I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility. On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this. I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value. What do you make of that, Dan? These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future. They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future. The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future. And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out. The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold. So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend. But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."
AMZN,Why Jim Cramer thinks the stock market isn't loved,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-jim-cramer-thinks-the-stock-market-isnt-loved-125154580.html,2025-10-08,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid Unfiltered onApple Podcasts,Amazon Music,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. While Warren Buffettsaid,“our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes? Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" hostJim Cramertold Yahoo Finance'sBrian Sozzion a new episode of theOpening Bid Unfilteredpodcast (see video above; listen below). “I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.” Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL). Save the date for Yahoo Finance's BIG Invest event! “FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.” For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.” This shorter-term thinking contrasts withBuffett’s sentimenton the stock market.

LXP Industrial Trust, which describes itself as ""a real estate investment trust focused on Class A warehouse and distribution real estate investments,"" announced the sale inan Oct. 1 news release.

AMZN,Starlink Rival AST SpaceMobile Gets Rare Sell Amid 254% Run,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starlink-rival-ast-spacemobile-gets-201652271.html,2025-10-08,"(Bloomberg) --AST SpaceMobile Inc. shares have more than tripled this year as the race for space-based cell phone connectivity heats up. With Elon Musk’s SpaceX division, Starlink, rushing to overtake it, AST is positioned for “painful corrections,” according to a Scotiabank analyst. “In the midst of an impressive bull market, extreme volatility in recent days has led to what we see as a valuation bubble,” analyst Andres Coello wrote in a note Tuesday downgrading the stock to sector underperform from sector perform. After a key satellite launch setback, he fears further delays may encourage some carriers to explore ditching AST SpaceMobile and moving to Starlink. Most Read from Bloomberg The Long Comeback of the Erie Canal London’s ‘Superloop’ Buses Seek to Speed Suburban Commutes In Chicago, a Soft Architecture Biennial for Hard Times The Federal Government Shutdown Adds to DC’s Economic Woes Chicago Mayor to Unveil Budget That Addresses Trump Funding Cuts More than 2 billion people across the globe lack access to the internet via a high-speed network, that has Starlink and AST SpaceMobile vying to build networks that connect cell phones directly to broadband via satellite. Such connectivity is also critical during disasters and in conflict zones. Based in Midland, Texas, AST SpaceMobile’s place as a key player in direct-to-device satellite connectivity has won over investors. The stock has surged  this year. In the last month, the stock has jumped about 83%, with its market capitalization vaulting to almost $27 billion. The biggest risks, according to Coello, are that the Block 2 Bluebird satellite — also known as FM1 — takes longer than expected or that a launch mission from India fails. If that were to happen SpaceX’s Starlink would stand to benefit. AST SpaceMobile shares advanced  to close at a fresh record in New York, erasing an earlier drop in the process and extending a winning streak triggered by the completion of the first successful satellite call over a Canadian wireless network with Bell. In a recent update, SpaceX said the next-generation of Starlink direct-to-cell satellites would use a wider range of frequencies that would support a capacity increase of more than 100 times that of current satellites, which will enable full 5G cellular connectivity in most environments. Additionally, the Elon Musk-backed company agreed to acquire wireless spectrum from EchoStar Corp. for $17 billion last month. “Our view is that the more time it takes for ASTS to bring a service to the market, the harder it will be to overcome Starlink’s improvements,” said Coello. He also reflected that speculation about a possible takeover by Amazon.com Inc. appears overblown. While it makes sense for Amazon’s Project Kuiper — a low Earth orbit satellite broadband network — to look for wireless synergies with AST, Coello noted that Amazon’s “plate looks full” with $13 billion to $16 billion in planned fixed capital expenditure investments. “We think a partnership would be mostly on the commercial front, perhaps with a small equity component,” Coello said. The stock currently has six buy-equivalent recommendations, four holds and one sell, according to analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Coello’s price target of $42.90 implies more than 40% downside to Tuesday’s close. (Updates shares throughout.)

(NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings. A chart publishedby the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla. According to thecompany’s latest Form 8-K filingwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion. The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC. The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date. The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet. The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include: • $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) • $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) • $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) • $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD) • $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR) The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions. As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’sdigital-assetcarrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset. The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

AMZN,Hertz Is Doubling Down on E-Commerce. Does That Make HTZ Stock a Buy Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-doubling-down-e-commerce-150526903.html,2025-10-08,"Hertz’s (HTZ) decision to let buyers complete the entire car purchasing process online comes at a moment when the auto market is shifting fast toward simple, digital buying habits. Over the past year, the company has added key partnerships, including a collaboration with Amazon (AMZN) Autos that pushed its e-commerce push into the headlines and put its inventory in front of a much larger audience. Industry forecasts suggest 15 percent of car purchases in the U.S. could be fully online by 2026, which makes this move less optional and more necessary as shoppers increasingly expect an end-to-end online experience. For Hertz, which manages a fleet of roughly 560,000 vehicles, the goal is clear: improve resale outcomes by making it easier to find, finance, and finalize a purchase without friction. This Crypto and AI Stock Just Got a Massive New Street-High Price Target That Implies Shares Could Double in the Next Year If You Love Dividends, Here Are 3 High-Yield Stocks to Buy Now AMD Is Soaring on an OpenAI Deal. Is AMD Stock a Better Buy Than Nvidia Here? Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today! HTZ shares climbed on these developments, reflecting growing attention on the strategy, but the key question remains the same: is this online pivot enough to justify the stock at current levels? Let’s take a closer look. Hertz runs a business that rents out cars and also sells its vehicles directly to shoppers through its growing used-car sales division. Over the past year, the stock has gained nearly 64% and is up more than 50% since January. Even as shares have climbed, the company’s numbers still look tough. Market value stands around $1.7 billion, but recent results include a loss of $0.34 per share for the last quarter and a trailing yearly loss of $3.32 per share. The story shifted for Hertz in the second quarter. This was the first time in almost two years that its core profits turned positive, with net income and adjusted EBITDA improving by about $500 million compared to last year. The strategy of buying, holding, and selling cars smarter seems to be working. Depreciation per vehicle is down to $251 a month, much lower than the company’s $300 target, and Hertz is using its cars much more efficiently, raising vehicle utilization to 83%. Moreover, retail car sales reached a five-year high for the second quarter, giving a clear signal that digital sales efforts are connecting with buyers. With over $1.45 billion in liquidity and a 3% drop in direct operating costs, Hertz has started to build a stronger financial footing. Hertz’s digital leap starts with turning its online catalog into a full e-commerce platform. Now shoppers can browse, finance, and purchase a car entirely through HertzCarSales.com with no dealership visits or phone calls. The updated flow also supports trade-ins, pre-qualification to see personal payment options, viewing protection plans, and completing final credit approval online. This makes the process clearer and easier while opening up access to more buyers in a way that matches how cars are increasingly being bought. This reach expands further with Hertz’s new presence on Amazon Autos. As Amazon’s first fleet dealer, Hertz puts thousands of used cars in front of a wider audience where buyers can shop on Amazon, finish the purchase, and pick up the car at a Hertz Car Sales location. The rollout starts in Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, with plans to scale across all 45 Car Sales locations nationwide. Pairing Hertz’s inventory with Amazon’s checkout journey gives the company strong visibility with shoppers who want a simple, online experience. Hertz is also widening the funnel with Rent2Buy, now in more than 100 cities. The program lets a shopper rent a car for up to three days for a small daily fee to get a true feel for it. If the car is purchased, that rental fee is waived. This solves a common concern for used-car buyers who want more time before committing. It also converts at a strong rate, with about 80% of renters going on to buy. By reducing hesitation and giving real road time, Rent2Buy builds confidence and lifts retail sales, directly supporting Hertz’s growing online and in-store selling efforts. Analysts show some short-term hope for Hertz as they expect earnings to turn positive this quarter with $0.06 per share. However, forecasts become more cautious afterward, with predictions of a $0.46 loss next quarter and deeper annual losses of $1.92 and $0.50 for 2025 and 2026, respectively. Despite these improvements, skepticism remains strong. J.P. Morgan’s Ryan Brinkman kept his “Underweight” rating in May, pointing out that much of Hertz’s recent financial gains come from temporary advantages such as lower fleet depreciation and high used car prices, which may not last. He also flagged risks like ongoing negative free cash flow, refinancing challenges, and lingering legal costs from the company’s past bankruptcy. This caution is shared across the board, as the 11 surveyed analysts currently rate HTZ as a consensus “Moderate Sell.” All say to either sell or hold, with no buys. Their average price target sits at $4.01, which is over 35% below the current stock price, suggesting the market’s optimism on the online pivot has not yet shifted the Street’s stance. At the end of the day, Hertz’s all-in digital pivot is gutsy, timely, and likely to keep it relevant in a rapidly changing market, yet the numbers and expert sentiment urge real caution. With shares trading well above Wall Street’s average target and fundamental risks like negative cash flow and legal overhangs still unresolved, HTZ stock has arguably outrun its underlying recovery for now. Unless Hertz can prove its new online engine delivers actual, lasting profit, odds are the stock will be more volatile than rewarding in the near term. The path upward needs real execution, not just headlines.

AMZN,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Tesla Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-tesla-123003386.html,2025-10-08,"How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well. The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks. What if you'd invested in Tesla (TSLA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TSLA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today? With that in mind, let's take a look at Tesla's main business drivers. Over the years, electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla has evolved into a dynamic technology innovator. It has transformed the EV space like Amazon changed the retail landscape and Netflix revolutionized entertainment. Tesla, which managed to garner a gold-standard reputation over the years, is now a far bigger entity than it was at the time of its IPO in 2010. However, with growing competition, Tesla's market share in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States has eroded to around 50%, from roughly 80% in 2020.The firm’s three-pronged business model approach of direct sales, servicing and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla, touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than just a car manufacturer. The firm also makes different kinds of technology like self-driving software, charging stations and battery development, et al. The technology titan has also made inroads into the solar and energy storage business. In fact, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk wants the company to be viewed primarily through the lens of AI and robotics rather than solely as an automotive company.Tesla operates under three segments: Automotive, Energy Generation/ Storage and Services/Others. While Automotive operations accounted for 78.9% of the total sales in 2024, revenues from Energy Generation/Storage and Services/Others constituted 10.3% and 10.8% of the total sales, respectively.Presently, this Texas-based company produces and sells five fully electric vehicles: The Model S sedan, the Model X sport utility vehicle (“SUV”), the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV and Cybertruck.Tesla’s first, second and third gigafactory are located in Nevada, New York and Shanghai, respectively. Its fourth and fifth gigafactories, are located in Berlin and Austin, respectively, and commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2021. Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Tesla, ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today. A $1000 investment made in October 2015 would be worth $28,157.42, or a gain of 2,715.74%, as of October 7, 2025, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation. Compare this to the S&P 500's rally of 240.43% and gold's return of 232.16% over the same time frame. Analysts are anticipating more upside for TSLA. Tesla's EV sales are feeling the heat from rising global competition. After recording its first-ever annual decline in deliveries in 2024, the slump has continued into 2025, with drops in both the first and second quarters. Automotive margins are shrinking, and operating expenses are rising. Discouragingly, Musk expects the upcoming quarters to be rough. Still, there are a few bright spots. The Energy Generation & Storage unit remains a core strength, and the Supercharger network continues to expand. Tesla has also launched its robotaxi service, though early reactions have been mixed. But the company believes that it holds significant cost and scalability advantages. If Tesla can deliver on its promises, this could be a major growth driver. Until then, caution is key. The stock has jumped 30.85% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2025; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.
