AAPL,Why Jim Cramer thinks the stock market isn't loved,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-jim-cramer-thinks-the-stock-market-isnt-loved-125154580.html,10/8/2025,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid Unfiltered onApple Podcasts,Amazon Music,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. While Warren Buffettsaid,“our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes? Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" hostJim Cramertold Yahoo Finance'sBrian Sozzion a new episode of theOpening Bid Unfilteredpodcast (see video above; listen below). “I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.” Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL). Save the date for Yahoo Finance's BIG Invest event! “FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.” For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.” This shorter-term thinking contrasts withBuffett’s sentimenton the stock market. He oncesaid, “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.” Read more:How do millionaires make their money​?

Impatience and skittishness are only two obstacles, according to Cramer. “The market got a bad rap because it seemed to be the playground of billionaires,” he said. “It got to be the image of the filthy rich, and the billionaires don’t help.” “I don’t want it to be a playground at all,” he added. “I want it to be the school for people to get rich as they did when they bought Nvidia.” Grace Williamsis a writer for Yahoo Finance.

AAPL,Qualcomm to acquire Arduino amid edge computing push,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-to-acquire-arduino-amid-edge-computing-push-130012919.html,10/8/2025,"Qualcomm (QCOM) announced on Monday that it is acquiring open-source hardware and software developer Arduino as it seeks to further grow its footprint in the edge computing space and push beyond its heavy reliance on the smartphone market. The companies did not release pricing details of the acquisition. Qualcomm previously acquired edge computing company Foundries.io in March 2024 and announced it was acquiring Edge Impulse in March 2025. Edge computing includes computers that help power processing far away from data centers, ranging from point-of-sale systems in retail stores to small sensors that allow workers to remotely monitor offshore wind turbines to internet of things (IoT) devices such as smart TVs and cars. Applications generally require a balance between computing performance and power usage. Italian company Arduino develops software and hardware that help power everything from hobbyist robots and rudimentary home automation projects to enterprise IoT platforms. “Arduino has built a vibrant global community of developers and creators,” Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm’s group GM of automotive, industrial, and embedded IoT, said in a statement. “By combining their open-source ethos with Qualcomm Technologies’ portfolio of leading-edge products and technologies, we’re helping enable millions of developers to create intelligent solutions faster and more efficiently — including a path towards global commercialization by leveraging the scale of our ecosystem,” he added. Qualcomm has been working to diversify its offerings at a time when the smartphone market continues to stagnate. Last month, the company debuted its second-generationSnapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chipsfor Windows laptops and smaller desktop platforms. It’s also making a deeper push into the automotive space. However, the company’s smartphone business still makes up an outsized portion of its overall revenue. In 2024, Qualcomm reportedtotal revenue of $33.2 billion. Of that, $24.9 billion came from handset sales. Its IoT business accounted for $5.4 billion, while its automotive segment brought in $2.9 billion. Apple (AAPL), which uses Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone, is also increasingly moving away from the company, deploying its own custom modems in its iPhone Air and iPhone 16e.

AAPL,"How To Pick the Next Apple Stock, According to Warren Buffett",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-next-apple-stock-according-144835186.html,10/8/2025,"Every investor wishes they had bought Apple stock in the 1990s, but you still would have realized a substantial return if you had bought it during the Great Recession or even five years ago. No investor, however, has benefited from Apple’s growth as much asWarren Buffett. Find Out:Why You Should Start Investing Now (Even If You Only Have $10) Read Next:10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than the Average New Vehicle Even though the “Oracle of Omaha” normally doesn’t touch tech stocks, hisBerkshire Hathaway companymade a notable exception for Apple — with a stake currently worth about $70 billion. While Apple remains Berkshire’s largest stock holding, its weighting in the portfolio has recently decreased. Regardless, it begs the question: What key details did Buffett see in Apple that you could apply to your future investments?Here are four things to consider. Apple is one of the best brands at maintaining customer loyalty. This advantage gives Apple more pricing power, as consumers will rush to upgrade their iPhones at high prices. Steve Jobs helped position the company as an innovator that thinks differently. This perception elevated Apple into aluxury products brandinstead of just a company that sells phones and computers. This customer loyalty helped Buffett view Apple as a consumer goods company instead of a tech company. This distinction, combined with Apple’s pricing power, convinced Buffett to load up on shares. For You:Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell Although Buffett quickly turned Apple into his largest holding after discovering the opportunity, he wasn’t the one who spotted it in the beginning. He only bought Apple with the help of Todd Combs, one of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio managers. Buffett established criteria and wanted Combs to find a stock that checked all of his boxes. Combs came back to Buffett with Apple stock and the buying began. Even the pros like Buffett consult other investors and experts to determine the best way to grow their money. It’s okay not to have all of the answers, and it’s natural not to have all of the answers. The people you surround yourself with will influence the quality of the answers and solutions you receive. Buffett did well in putting Combs on the team, and it resulted in one of hismost lucrative investments. Buffett’s portfolio manager picked a stock that produced tremendous returns for Buffett, but he gave him three criteria to pinpoint agood investmentopportunity. The first one was a cheap price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. You can calculate a stock’s P/E ratio if you divide a stock’s price by its earnings per share. For instance, a stock that’s worth $100 and has an annual $2 EPS ends up with a 50 P/E ratio. That’s a high P/E ratio relative to the S&P 500 and Buffett wanted something cheaper. Buffett specifically wanted a stock with a P/E ratio of no more than 15 based on the next 12 months’ projected earnings. Buffett’s two additional parameters revolve aroundearnings growth. He stipulated that management must feel 90% confident that a stock would report higher earnings over the next five years. Finally, they needed a 50% confidence level that the company’s net income would grow by 7% or more for at least five years. Buffett had to narrow the list to large-cap stocks since he was eager to invest billions of dollars into the company. However, retail investors can use this same approach with smaller companies.

Travis Hoium:Are smart glasses the future of technology hardware? Motley Fool Money starts down. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium joined by Lou Whiteman and Emily Flippen. We're going to jump right in today, and the big topic I thought for this week was Apple at least reportedly pulling back on their lighter Vision Pro headset. They're going to be moving in the same direction, it looks like asMetahas with their Ray Ban glasses, this AR technology. Emily, what are your thoughts on this whole space and where Meta and Apple fits into it? Emily Flippen:I'm incredibly disappointed by Apple here. Look, Apple invested a lot of time and resources into convincing all of us that the future was in these lightweight, daily wearable glasses that were the visionary of spatial computing. Then a year later, just backtracks and it's not clear to me if this is, a desperate pull for them to say, no, me, too, when they see the innovation that Meta is doing and literally the metaverse, or if this is just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. But in my opinion, I just am so incredibly bearish. Pivoting toward heavy duty VR glasses when it seems like we have years and years of evidence coming out of Meta that consumers just do not want this. Travis Hoium:It seems like a space where they're throwing stuff at the wall, and we don't know exactly what's going to stick. But at least we know these lightweight things are going to stick a little bit. That seems like a little bit of the move in the right direction, Lou, but it's still it seems like this is a money losing proposition for the foreseeable future. Lou Whiteman:We should say that this is one report, and we don't know what's going on, really. Apple has $65 billion in cash. I feel like they can do both. But look, the cynical take here is, I can't figure out to spin is Meta was right or Apple is really that desperate. Because in a way, this seems like it's validation of everything Meta is doing. In a way, it's Apple are they really just they need something? I agree with Emily. I see more potential in the Vision Pro. There's also more of a chance an outright flop. I don't get the obsession with glasses right now, and I'm worried to see everyone pushing in that direction. Travis Hoium:One of the things that was interesting when the Vision Pro came out is look, I've been in the VR space for almost a decade now, and what was unique about it is it was almost like an AR pair of glasses while actually being VR. The pass through was better than we've ever had in any other device. It seemed like they were, even at that time, moving toward this AI future but the technology wasn't quite there yet. They hadn't miniaturized things enough to get to even where Meta and Ray Ban are with their current glasses. Maybe we were headed this direction all along, and like Lou said, they're walking and chewing gum at the same time. They're probably doing both of these things, but they're maybe now saying, hey, look, the Vision Pro has been a flop, and people are at least a little excited about these sunglasses or these glasses from Meta. Emily, is that maybe the right way to think about it? They're seeing what's gonna work and what's not, and they're seeing Meta's success. They have always been a follower. They're never usually the first company to release a device, so maybe that's the right strategy. Emily Flippen:Yes, that's a really generous interpretation, I think, Travis. I think this is an issue. Really, I think it's an issue of bloat. I say that as somebody who is a fan of Apple. Ultimately, Apple is still a hardware business when push comes to shove. They have to be on the bleeding edge of whatever the new exciting hardware accessory is, even if that ends up getting commoditized, because otherwise, they could lose their position as one of the largest companies in the world. I understand the desperate need to be there. If Meta is onto something, Apple needs to be right there too. But here's the problem when you have so many extra billions of dollars in cash flow, is that it really does allow you to lack discipline where you choose to invest your CAPEX. I wish there was more focus coming out of the Apple Management team. Again, to your point, we don't exactly know how many resources are being put behind this larger version of these AR VR glasses. But I really do think that it's disappointing to see them spread out their attention when the Vision Pro hasn't lived up to its potential yet, and there is potential there. They might be a little early, but they invested more time and resources into convincing consumers about why this would be an addition to their everyday life. That can actually be onto something great. My concern is that when you do two things poorly, you do nothing well. I wish they would just focus on doing one thing well. Lou Whiteman:Here's a question, and I don't know if this will end up being bullish or bearish, but, the Apple value proposition from the start was always, it just works. In a way that was tech for the normies. I'm a normie, so I appreciate that. I am yet to be convinced that the normies want these glasses, that there really is the market that they think there is. To me, I don't see it doing anything right now that you can't do on your phone, so it's an accessory to the phone, not a replacement. The watch is, too. The watch has done pretty well, but the watch is half the price of these. Do we want. Travis Hoium:The watch is also nowhere near the market share that the iPhone. Lou Whiteman:It is a niche product. Do we want an accessory that costs as much as the phone? I doubt it. The Glass Half Full is, Apple really sees a chance to do what they did with the iPhone relative to the Palm Pre and all those. They really have come up with something that is that next step. Glass Half Empty is that this is going to just be like the watch and be just another product out there that can't move the needle. When in theory, if they get the Vision Pro right over time, that could be a whole new product category. This is, again, what are we swinging for hits or swinging for home runs? Because this feels like going for a base hit and giving up on the home run swing. Travis Hoium:I'll start with you, Lou, do you think the combination of artificial intelligence and these different form factors. Usually the technology revolutions, the disruption that happens, it comes with a new form factor. The mainframe, the PC, the smartphone, brought about all new winners, new business models. We've been talking about new form factors in AI for quite a while. The pendant didn't seem to stick. It seems like glasses has a chance. But then you run into this strange, I don't know if it's an uncanny valley where I can see some real value in, look, I can see in our recording, I can see your names. Sometimes I look down there when I'm reading the outro. I don't know why. I just do it. I'm meeting new parents as my kids go to school. I know I've met you before. I know you said your name, but I can't remember. If it just popped up on my glasses, that'd be great. On the flip side of that, if we're constantly recording everything all the time, that seems like a pretty dystopian vision of the future. It seems like we do need that killer app and we're just not there yet, and nobody's quite figured that out. Is that a fair critique of this next gen issue? It's almost like we're in the Apple Newton phase of the industry. We're 10 years too early. Lou Whiteman:Let me give you a more subtle critique. Because I'm not going to go dystopian, although I see that, I see the fear. But look, we talk about what a distraction the phone is when you're driving, when you're walking down the street, whatever. Maybe, yes. If it just popped up Emily's name, if I couldn't think of it, that would be a help. But 90% of the things, be it directions, watchingNetflixfor gosh sakes while you're driving or something. All of these things that seem to be obvious use cases, that just doesn't seem like a good idea for me. Again, it does feel like that, yes, it's a neat accessory onto the phone, but largely, the reason this is the next big thing is, I think, because no one has any better ideas, not because it is a great idea. Emily Flippen:That's an interesting way to put it. I'll just quickly tap off by saying, I wish Apple was OK with being second, in some cases. I think when you look at the success of the smartphone, Apple wasn't the first company to come out with a smartphone, but they waited for the proof and the pudding there withBlackberrybefore they entered the market and destroyed it. The same is true for smart watches. They waited for Garmin and others to come out, fit bit to show the demand for watches, and then said, let's take this market that already exists, and let's crush it. The market doesn't exist right now for these glasses. I think that's part of the problem that Apple's running up against. Travis Hoium:When we come back, we are going to get to Tesla's phenomenal delivery numbers for the third quarter of 2025 and see what the future looks like because this may be a peak for a while. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. One of the other big pieces of news for the week was Tesla had a phenomenal quarter. Deliveries were 497,099 vehicles. That was a 7.4% increase from a year ago. The problem is, the $7,500 tax credit ended at the end of the third quarter. Emily, is this going to be as good as it gets for Tesla, at least for the foreseeable future? Emily Flippen:I think it's a fair statement. I do think two things can be true at once, which is, that this was a great delivery month they put up, but it was also this deadline sprint that you mentioned for people to place orders before the tax credit expired. If I had to estimate, I would imagine that we're probably looking at a softer fourth quarter here, despite how strong the third quarter was in terms of deliveries, but at the same time, I'm still really bullish on the entire EV sector, especially in the United States, but across the world. I think the rumors of its death, so to speak, have been greatly exaggerated. There's a lot of people out there, a lot of investors who think that without government incentives, demand for electric vehicles just won't be there. It's an interesting argument, and it's one that I think we're going to get some more evidence toward or against as we see these tax credits expire, but big picture, we've seen higher interest rates, and that softens demand for more expensive cars. EVs are still on average, more expensive than more traditional vehicles, and you still need to have the installation and charging options. A lot of people choose to finance those if they have them installed on their house. Of course, with higher interest rates, less people being willing to finance at higher rates. There's a lot of factors that are going against EV adoption right now that are unlikely to persist over the long term. That's the thing where I'm like, it's great to see a Sean Carter from Tesla. I'm not expecting that to persist for Tesla or any other EV maker. I thinkFord's CEO, which is commenting earlier this week that he expects EV market share to drop by half for this foreseeable future. Crazy numbers. But when I zoom out 10 years, I'm very not worried about electric vehicles here. Lou Whiteman:Here's the interesting thing to me. These are the times autos are very cyclical. These are the times when historically, the big giants of the industry, based at Detroit, through most of the industry, they've used their balance sheet to muscle out competitors. When pricing becomes a problem, when affordability becomes a problem, and Ford today still has that great captive Auto Finance unit. GM is rebuilding theirs, where they really can offer you a deal you can't refuse. Someone else who's smaller, in this case, aRivian, back in the day with others just can't afford to. On paper, Tesla is better positioned to do that than even the Detroit companies. They have a great balance sheet. However, Tesla, unlike all of these companies, also has a huge long list of things other than consumer finance they want to put their money to. I feel like to some extent, Tesla's near term destiny is in their own hands. If they want to minimize the blow of the tax credit, I think they have the wherewithal to do that. I don't know if for long term investors, that would be the best use of their capital, though, but I mean, I do think it's an interesting moment. In terms of the big picture for EVs, for me, right now, it makes sense that hybrids are where it's at because I think hybrids offer you a better deal, and I'm biased because I have a hybrid. Maybe I'm saying that. To me, the future of EVs is not tied to tax credits. It's not tied to what Elon Musk thinks when he wakes up in the morning. You tell me how and when that Model 2 hits the streets. You tell me if that Model 2 really is a $25,000 car. I will tell you what I think the near term future for Tesla EVs are. Similarly, all of these companies, Ford has a pickup truck. That's a very similar value proposition. Tell me whether or not those actually can be made at profit anytime soon. That, I think, is going to be the answer to the question of how quickly and how strongly we see EVs take off from here, not a $7,000 tax credit. Emily Flippen:Why are we so focused on Tesla and Ford when we actually already have evidence that is the case.BYDout of China has been making profitable, low cost electric vehicles that are getting worldwide adoption. We don't see them a lot here in the United States because of our own tariff regime and lack of importing there. But I do think that we have evidence that this battery company, originally a battery company now a big car company can do it. There's no reason to believe that others can't eventually get there, as well. But that evidence exists. It's just a matter of, to your point, Lou, how quickly? Travis Hoium:Absolutely. Speaking of companies that are growing in EVs, I think this one's fascinating isGeneral Motors, do you know how much their EV growth was year over year? Gulf the third quarter, 105% to 144,668 vehicles. The Equinox EV, which is their entry level, $35,100. I believe that's less than you can get a Tesla for today. It does seem the dynamics have shifted quite a bit. What will be fascinating, they're still focusing on big trucks and SUVs. That's where the money is made, even though Tesla used to be high margin. Their margins are now lower than the traditional automakers today. It's partly because they're not making these expensive trucks and SUVs, which are selling like crazy today. This is going to be fascinating because it does seem like one thing that's going to be consistent is the market will probably not be growing as much as it would have had that $7,500 tax credit remained, and therefore, it's going to be more competitive because there is more supply coming into the mat. Lou Whiteman:The one caveat there, I would say on just looking at GM numbers is, I think the dealer model provides more incentive to try and get move metal before the tax credit disappears because as soon as it's on location, that's the dealers problem, not the automakers problem. The dealers don't have that balance sheet to put to work. They wanted to move that metal. But we'll see if it holds up, that's great for GM. Travis Hoium:I want to get your thoughts on we have the end of the third quarter just happened this week on Tuesday. That means the earning season is going to be coming very soon. Emily, what are you looking at for this earning season as it starts next week and the week after? Emily Flippen:I'm actually looking for companies that are very obviously sandbagging with guidance. I say that, I think we all expect for guidance this quarter to come in weaker. It was that case last quarter. We are living in a really uncertain environment now, so it makes sense that not only are companies expecting their profit margins to be squeezed, especially with weak consumer spending, they don't know what's going to happen with inflation or tariffs, whatever the overhang may be. I always love it when a company's management team is always a bit more pessimistic than I'm, and sometimes I can be a red flag, but sometimes I can also be a buying opportunity. For instance, I think aboutDutch Bros, who when you look back at their business at this point last year, kept guiding for low to mid single digit same store sales growth, so much weaker than what they were putting up because management was just that uncertain about the cannibalization that'd be happening with their business or consumer spending. Quarter after quarter, they just kept hitting it out of the park they only recently raised guidance. But that mismatch, in my opinion, between a really conservative management team and a really strong business, where I can see their path to out performance, even more than maybe management can, can be appealing because if you see shares fall really dramatically based on weak guidance that you think is a hurdle that can be easily passed, it can be a buying opportunity. Lou Whiteman:It's so funny you say that because I was thinking the other day. I was like, I'm more excited about the opportunity to go shopping this earning season than normal. I do think that that's yeah, we're ripe for it, I think. All the containers are there. As far as what I'm looking for, I'll go big picture. I'm focused on margins just across the board. I'm really curious how much the macro is eating into margins. We know there's tariffs out there. We know that the consumer is struggling to get a feel for how much that companies are eating it. I think I'm more interested in looking at margin change over time than I'm even, revenue growth or earnings growth. I want to know not what happened in the last three months. I want to know what to expect the next three, six months to come, and I think that is at least a little bit of a window into what's going on out there. Travis Hoium:Lou, do you think tariffs is going to be a bigger topic of discussion or less than it was over the last two quarters? I'll say maybe the second quarter, first quarter was a lot of, we have no idea what's going on. Second quarter, companies have gotten their heads around it. Third quarter, now we're really in it. Are we going to hear a lot about it, or is it going to just be in the background? Lou Whiteman:I think we're going to hear a ton about it, but I think it's going to be in the guidance side because we're in the holiday quarter now, and I think that that's going to be front of mind. Travis, I've used this with you before the boiling frog analogy that you, tariffs are not a light switch. It's just over time, suddenly what happened? The holiday season seems like if I was a CEO, that would be front of mind for me at the holiday season. I think you'll be hearing about it a lot in the guidance. Travis Hoium:It is going to be fascinating to see what companies can who has pricing power. Who doesn't? Who has to, like you said, eat those tariffs and who's able to pass them on to customers and where they're impacting a lot to learn over the next few weeks. When we come back, I'm going to have Emily and Lou take an over or under position on a bunch of predictions for the rest of the year you're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. Today, we're going to play a little game called over-under. I'm going to give a prediction about something that's going to happen in the economy or the market, and Emily and Lou are going to guess whether they think there's going to be an over or under. Let's start with the topic that we discussed earlier, Metas Glasses. They sold about 1 million pairs of these smart glasses in 2024. That's a pretty big number. My question is, are they going to sell over or under 5 million units in 2028? Emily, I'm going to have you go first over or under 5 million. Emily Flippen:I feel this will come as no surprise for anybody who listen to the first half of the show, but I have to go under here. I just don't see the use cases for it on Meta side. When you look at Metas financials, this business spent more on CapEx in the last 12 months than the business generated in operating income or an operating cash flow in all of 2022. They are just throwing money at the wall, and it's amazing to me how much money they're investing into various things, but nothing is sticking with consumers. Ultimately, you can't force a consumer to come out and buy a new product if they don't see a use case for it. It's amazing to me that they even sold 1 million units in 2024. That is peak hype, in my opinion. Unless something really sticks here for Meta, I expect that number to actually fall over the course of the next. Lou Whiteman:Wow. I'm going to use Emily's words and come to the conclusion that over. Because, yes, Zuck needs this, and Zuck is more than willing to spend money, and Zuck is still hurting about. Travis Hoium:You may just give them away. Lou Whiteman:I wasn't going to go quite that far, but since you got there, I don't think that profitability, I'm glad we're talking volume. We're talking units, not profitability or success here. Travis Hoium:But, I don't think we're under the delusion that these are going to be profitable in the next three years. Lou Whiteman:My guess is, he's going to move these darn things. Come high or high water. Travis Hoium:This will be interesting because I do think the adoption of the VR space really hit a wall. But glasses are different. Glasses are a little bit more passive. They're not quite lower cost, which is, I think, interesting $800 for these new display glasses. But there's definitely a market for it. The other thing to think about, too, is if you bought one in 2024, when are you going to want to update that? If there's not a lot of new features, that could be a headwind, too. We'll be fascinated to see how successful or unsuccessful Meta is moving into more of the glasses space. Let's go to the overall economy, and I want to get your thoughts on mortgage rates. The reason that I think this is important is housing is a huge driver of the economy. It's huge portion of our money is spent on rents, on mortgages. It provides tons of jobs. Higher mortgage rates, at least than we've had over the past decade, has been a real headwind. Fed funds rate is coming down. The rate that the Fed controls is coming down. The problem is, the longer term rates that drive mortgage rates and the borrowing rates for companies is not coming down at the same rate. Right now, we have a mortgage rate average of about 6.3% a year from now, do you think those mortgage rates are going to be over or under 6%? Down just slightly from where we are today, Lou how you go? Lou Whiteman:Getting a real time lesson in the limits to the Fed's power. Wait, there's just so much going on other than the Fed that's driving these long term rates. I'm going under, and I'm not sure it's a good thing. I'm all over the place. What's going to happen in the economy in the next year? But I'm increasingly worried, I think, and I think that there's going to need to be more and more aggressiveness. I think housing is a natural place for both politics and policy to get involved here. I don't want to go too much under there, but I have a feeling we'll be eventually pushed downward one way or the other. Emily Flippen:Might be a hot take here, but we're sitting at about 6% right now, and I think the general expectation is that the market can handle the housing market can handle these high rates for very much longer, and that the Fed is going to continue to cut rates, which eventually, hopefully, even though there is obviously a disconnect here between the Fed is doing and what lenders are doing, that will eventually come down, but I have to say over. I think mortgage rates are going to be over 6% one year from now. The reason is is because I don't actually think we're going to get as many rate cuts as the market is expecting. I think that tepidness is going to pull over into the market for mortgages. The reason I say that is because a lot of the inflation data, despite the fact that it has cooled off, and it's down, although obviously not to Fed's target rates, I expect that we probably heat up as a lot more of these price increases from tariffs are passed along to consumers in the back half of this year, a lot of that evidence has shown that companies so far have eaten the price of these tariffs, and that is eventually that dam is eventually going to break. In my opinion, that's unfortunately going to impact interest rates. Travis Hoium:I do think it is interesting that we have not really seen we've been talking about this on these shows for months. We have not really seen the impact of tariffs yet. The inventory cycle for a lot of these companies is not a month or two. If tariffs went in place, April 2, it's not like you're going to see that in stores, even in June. They were planning in April now for the holidays. This is when we're going to see those price increases. I have kids. We're buying stuff for them all the time, and you're seeing those prices go up. I'm interested to see if that impacts consumers. Emily, is your point just that the market is going to say, you know what? Sure, these rates are going to come down short term, but long term, they're going to have to go back up to fight inflation. Emily Flippen:I think it's going to be a combination between a weaker labor market and inflation here that's going to put the Fed in a bit of an odd position. Ultimately, I think, whenever you see broader economic concerns in combination with the dynamics that we're seeing in terms of the housing market today, I would just be surprised if rates fall that dramatically within one year. I hope I am wrong. I do tend to be a pessimist, and I like to be pleasantly surprised. I hope a year from now we're sitting here in October 2026, talking about our nice four per to 5% mortgages. But that feels like a pipe dream to me these days. Lou Whiteman:You know what's fascinating, Emily, I'm pessimistic, too, but I think in the near term, it's easier to play games with it, and in the long term, it eventually comes back to bite you. I'm focused on the one year, too, but who knows? That's what makes market. Travis Hoium:Let's quickly do an over under on the number of fed rate cuts in the next 12 months. Emily, it sounds you're going under three. That's where I'm going to set the bar. But is that officially your call? Emily Flippen:It is. In fact, I'll tell you what. In the next 12 months, I will even go further. I think we have maybe one rate cut. Travis Hoium:The market is pricing into this year. Emily Flippen:Yes. Travis Hoium:You don't think that's going to happen in 12 months? Emily Flippen:I don't talked about this on Motley Fool Money in the past, I believe. I think I expected one rate cut in September, which we got. Despite the fact that all of the blind polling here from the Federal Reserve does indicate that even the people on the panel themselves expect a number of rate cuts over the remainder of the year. Emily Flippen:We don't have, obviously, with the government shutdown, our most recent jobs data, and inflation has not moderated. I can't emphasize this enough. It has not moderated to the extent that the Fed wants it to moderate. It's still well above their target rate. We've actually seen it accelerates on a month over month basis, and there's a fair bit of evidence that despite the fact that tariffs have not had the impact that I think a lot of economists and investors fear to this point, which is wonderful, that that shoe is, in my opinion, likely to drop toward the back half of the year. Again, I really hope I'm wrong here. I really hope mortgage rates come down. I really hope we have three rate cuts. But I'm betting on one rate cut in the next. Lou Whiteman:I really hope I'm wrong, Ron Gur, because for the record, I agree. If you want me, I play pundit. I agree with everything Emily said. I was reluctant to even cut the first time. I was scared about that, and I don't want rate cuts. I'm worried about inflation. But again, I think politics plays into this, and especially as the year goes on with the Fed. I think market dynamics is providing pressure. Officially, I would push to three. I think we are at three. But, if anything, if you force me not to push, I'm going to take the over. That scares me a bit, but I do think that just the pressure on the Fed to cut rates is only going to accelerate as Pal steps away and as other changes, and as just assist the situation, I'm afraid we are going to deteriorate some from here. Travis Hoium:Lou, I did allow you to push on that one, but this one, we're going to make things a little bit more difficult.NVIDIAis the most valuable company in the world, $4.6 trillion market cap;Microsoft, 3.9, Apple, 3.8 trillion. My question for you, is NVIDIA going to be over or under the 1.5? Basically, are they going to be first or are they going to be lower than first? Most valuable company on January 1st, 2030. You have a little over four years between now and then. Are they going to maintain this ranking? Lou Whiteman:Any good gambler has to take the field on that. I'm going to take the field and say under. However, NVIDIA is a pretty good choice to be there. It's a great company. They have staying power. But no, if you're going to give me every company or NVIDIA and have it play out four years, I'll take everybody else. Emily Flippen:Unfortunately, if you look historically speaking, companies that are the largest in the world when you zoom out in a 5-10 year period don't tend to maintain that positioning. I have to agree with Lou here, I to take the under. That being said, if anybody can do it, it's NVIDIA. This would be, and you hate as an investor to say this time is different, but this could be the exception to the rule. Travis Hoium:We'll end on this one. I want to get your S&P 500 picks over the next 12 months. Over or under 7,000. As we're recording, we're at about 6,750. I'm giving a little bit of a gain, 5% gain or so. Do you think a year from now we are under 7,000 on the S&P 500, Emily? Emily Flippen:This is an interesting question because I think everyone in their dough will tell you right now that the S&P 500 is overvalued. The market is overvalued. We have all of these headwinds, consumers are feeling hurt. The government, as we are talking, is literally shut down, and the stock market is up. Make that make sense, exactly. There is this real disconnect that's happening between the American consumer, the American economy, and, I guess, general vibes of the American people here versus what we're seeing in the market. I fear that the irrationality, to some extent, can maintain over the course of the next year because it hasn't made a lot of sense to this point. That being said, I can't get behind why that would be. I have to take the under. I think it's less than five. In fact, I think the stock markets probably down from where we are today a year from now. Again, I hope I'm wrong, and pessimists sound smart, optimists tend to make more money, so I'm staying fully invested, regardless of what my short-term prediction is for the markets. But it's hard for me to rationalize how the market could go"

AAPL,Strategy Ranks Among Top Five U.S. Corporate Treasuries With $80B in Bitcoin Holdings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategy-ranks-among-top-five-153222648.html,10/8/2025,"Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings. A chart publishedby the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla. According to thecompany’s latest Form 8-K filingwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion. The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC. The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date.

AAPL,Reform treasurer admits looking stupid after company was ‘defrauded’ – court,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reform-treasurer-admits-looking-stupid-153140925.html,10/8/2025,"Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy has told the High Court he looks “stupid” for believing “blatant lies” told to him by the head of a technology start-up who allegedly defrauded a company he owns. Candy Ventures Sarl (CVS), a portfolio of companies founded by Mr Candy, is taking legal action against Dutch businessman Robert Bonnier over allegations he “duped” it into investing about 7.5 million euros (£6.5 million) into his social media start-up, Aaqua BV. A trial in London was told, earlier on Tuesday, that Mr Bonnier claimed Apple and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) were set to invest one billion US dollars (£740 million) in Aaqua. This led to CVS swapping shares in podcasting firm Audioboom for “worthless” shares in Aaqua in 2021, with CVS now asking the court to rescind the investment or order Mr Bonnier and Aaqua to pay £5.7 million in damages. Mr Bonnier is representing himself but has been blocked from defending the claim after breaching court orders, meaning he cannot cross-examine witnesses called by CVS. Giving evidence on Tuesday, Mr Candy said that Mr Bonnier’s “blatant lies” about Apple and LVMH’s investment were “a very good story”, but stated: “It is disgraceful what has happened.” He said: “I look stupid here now in court, but he was so believable and not just believable to investors, but believable to employees who left high-paid jobs.” He continued: “We want justice for them.” He added: “I am lucky enough, I can afford it, but whether I can get anything out of this, ever, who knows.” He concluded: “It is not some conspiracy here. “What has happened is we have all been defrauded by Mr Bonnier, and slowly we put the jigsaw pieces together.” Mr Candy, who became Reform’s treasurer last December, owns 90% of CVS but is not a director, with the firm instead managed by his business partner, Steven Smith. In a witness statement, Mr Candy said he first became aware of Aaqua in 2020 and met Mr Bonnier in Dubai in 2021, finding him to be an “extremely capable operator”. He continued that Mr Bonnier “was apparently very well connected”, with the Dutchman claiming he personally knew Apple chief executive Tim Cook and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and was frequently meeting with their executives. CVS agreed in February 2021 to transfer 1.5 million shares in podcasting firm Audioboom to Aaqua, worth about £6.5 million. It also agreed to purchase 15,000 Aaqua shares, which were believed to be worth about 7.5 million euros (£6.5 million), a value which barristers for CVS told the court was “false and artificial”. Mr Candy said in his witness statement that CVS’s belief that Apple and LVMH were involved was “utterly fundamental to its investment decision”. He continued that after CVS began legal action in 2022, he discovered that Mr Bonnier had no dealings with Apple or LVMH, and there was “zero chance” that either would invest in Aaqua. He said: “Had I known then that Apple and LMVH had no intention to invest at all, or that Mr Bonnier had had no dealings with Apple or LVMH, as subsequently became clear, then there would have been no business case to invest. “The whole proposition was far too risky otherwise, and there would have been no reason to invest at all.” He concluded: “Had CVS known the truth, namely that there was no interest from Apple or LVMH at all, it would not have invested one penny in Aaqua.” In his witness statement, Mr Bonnier said he personally invested more than 20 million euros (£17 million) into Aaqua and was “absolutely convinced” of its potential. He continued that he met executives from Apple and LVMH and believed that they would “invest at the appropriate time”. He also said that he believed that it was “clear” to CVS in 2021 that “no agreement had been entered into with Apple and that any such agreement was a long way off”, and that he did not believe any of his “mis-statements” caused CVS to enter into the Aaqua agreement. “If a company such as Apple had already agreed to an investment or such an investment was imminent, there would have been no need for me to have any interaction with CVS for investment,” he said. The trial before Mr Justice Bright is due to conclude on Thursday."
AAPL,"Qualcomm supply policy ‘innocuous and lawful’, tribunal hears",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-supply-policy-innocuous-lawful-151954401.html,10/8/2025,"Lawyers for technology giant Qualcomm have described its supply policy as “innocuous and lawful” as they opened their submissions at a competition tribunal. A class action against Qualcomm that, if successful, could result in payouts for UK smartphone users, entered its second day of an expected five-week duration at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London. Consumer group Which? has brought the claim on behalf of around 29 million UK Apple and Samsung smartphone users. It will focus on whether Qualcomm held market power and, if so, whether it abused its position as a dominant company. Which? alleges Qualcomm breached UK competition law by taking advantage of its dominance in the patent-licencing and chipset markets. It claims that this resulted in Qualcomm being able to charge manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung inflated fees for technology licences, which have then been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices or lower-quality smartphones. Daniel Jowell KC, for Qualcomm, told the tribunal: “You’ll recall that in the run up to this trial, on multiple occasions we have sought to tease out of the claimant what actually is the precise conduct that is said to constitute the alleged abuse. He added: “What turns this innocuous and lawful chipset supply policy into the abusive and unlawful NLNC (No Licence No Chips). We got to the stage where it became very puzzling because no one has ever contested that Qualcomm can’t maintain both a patent licencing business and a chipset supply business. Indeed any such suggestion would be rather absurd. He went on: “That left it very unclear to us what alternative conduct or business model the CR (class representative) proposed that Qualcomm could and would have adopted instead of the CSP (Chipset Supply Practice) in order for Qualcomm to comply with competition law.” And he told the tribunal: “If the essence, or if you like the hallmark, of the abusive conduct is the effective dictation of terms, you just don’t find it in the evidence.” On Monday, Philip Moser KC, for Which?, told the hearing: “The nature of the abuse, where the abuse manifests itself, is in the area of negotiation of the royalty. “And Qualcomm, instead of competitive negotiation, uses the inherent risk, or sometimes explicitly stated threat, of chipset supply disruption, software delay, to foreclose a normal discussion of royalties, and conditions for the licences. “Instead, it’s ‘unless you take our package of licences at Qualcomm’s rate and on our terms, unless you do that there are no chips’. “And Qualcomm’s terms include a royalty at a rate which we say is likely to be inflated. And that’s payable on every phone whether it uses Qualcomm’s chips or not.” If Which?’s first trial is successful, there will then be a second trial focusing on Qualcomm’s conduct and the damage suffered by the class, that Which? has calculated at around £480 million. Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased between October 1 2015 and January 9 2024. It estimates that individual consumers could be due an average of around £17 per phone if the action is successful. Which? said the action was “vital” to obtain redress for consumers and to “send a clear message to powerful companies like Qualcomm that if they engage in harmful, anticompetitive practices, Which? stands ready to take action”. Which? chief executive Anabel Hoult said: “This trial is a huge moment. It shows how the power of consumers – backed by Which? – can be used to hold the biggest companies to account if they abuse their dominant position. “Without Which? bringing this claim on behalf of millions of affected UK consumers, it would simply not be realistic for people to seek damages from the company on an individual basis – that’s why it’s so important that consumers can come together and claim the redress they are entitled to.”"

AAPL,Could You Retire Today If You Had Bought Apple Stock 10 Years Ago?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-retire-today-had-bought-142007261.html,10/8/2025,"Apple stock is one of the “magnificent seven,” a term applied to tech stocks whose growth has outperformed the S&P 500. Those gains are significant, but are they enough that if you had bought Apple stock 10 years ago, you couldretiretoday? Learn More:I Asked ChatGPT What the Stock Market Will Look Like in 100 Days — Here’s What It Said Read Next:5 Types of Cars Retirees Should Stay Away From Buying That depends on the numbers. We threw together a couple scenarios to see if you could be retiring comfortably on Apple stockif you were lucky enough to buy in a decade ago. A decade ago, Apple stock was trading between $24 and $25 per share (in split-adjusted terms). Since then, Apple has had several stock splits, which has greatly increased the size of returns for long-term shareholders. A stock split is when a company increases the number of its shares while lowering the price of each share proportionally, so the total value of your investment stays the same. This can be a psychological move as much as a financial one — removing barriers to trading high-priced stocks. So, let’s assume you invested $10,000 in Apple stock a decade ago. The math works out to purchasing around 416 shares with your $10,000 (this doesn’t count transaction or broker fees). That $10,000 would today be worth around $100,000 if dividends were reinvested (we’re rounding up to make the math simple). Find Out:Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell While $100,000 would not fund a retirement alone, it certainly could give you a nice slush fund to draw upon, assuming you had other retirement funds. For example, if you withdrew from your $100,000 by thecommon 4% withdrawal rule, you could take out $4,000 per year, which could pay for some expenses but it wouldn’t be enough to live on. Probably better to leave that money invested, to keep reaping the benefits of compound interest and further stock splits. To generate something closer to a modest yearly income, say $40,000 per year, you’d need a portfolio of around $1 million. To have gotten to $1 million from Apple alone over 10 years, at $24/share, you’d have needed roughly 41,666 shares able to grow (with reinvested dividends and splits) to $1,000,000. So, if you’d invested around $100,000 in Apple a decade ago and held through splits and dividends, that might have put you at roughly a $1 million portfolio today, enough for a modest retirement income. Reading these figures today could inspire someone to move a huge chunk of their investments into Apple today, but this could be a bad move, despite its performance, according to Chloe Elise, CEO and financial education expert atDeeper Than Money. “Even when you’re looking at a strong investment, there’s a lot of risk to put all your eggs in one basket… singular companies fluctuate all the time, and even strong companies have ended up going bankrupt or closing.” Instead of trying to bank on ahigh-performing stock, Elise insisted, “Have a diversified portfolio. It’s as simple as that.” You can allocate a small portion of your investments into companies you feel passionate about or that you see growing, but don’t bet your entire retirement account on it, she urged. “Diversification allows for your portfolio to grow strongly even if a specific company takes a hit.” If you didn’t invest in Apple stock 10 years ago, don’t give yourself a hard time. Elise said, “Just like how you can’t accurately predict today what company will be a top performer 10 years from now, you can’t blame your past self for not knowing that.” She assured that there are many strategies to achieve retirement that don’t require you to make a lucky stock pick. For most people, a more diversified portfolio plus amix of income streamsis a safer path to a sustainable retirement.

AAPL,Is Broadcom’s Valuation Justified After OpenAI AI Chip Partnership Announcement?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-valuation-justified-openai-ai-140630441.html,10/8/2025,"Let’s be honest, if you’re debating your next move with Broadcom stock, you’re not alone. With shares jumping an impressive 93.5% over the past year and a staggering 881.6% over the last five, plenty of investors are asking if the best gains are already behind us or if there’s more in store. In just the past week alone, Broadcom climbed 2.3%, shrugging off minor volatility and reminding us it is still a force to be reckoned with in the tech sector. But what’s really driving these moves? Some news has stoked excitement, such as OpenAI announcing a partnership to co-develop advanced AI chips with Broadcom. This partnership highlights Broadcom’s integral role in the AI supply chain. On the other hand, headlines that Apple is cutting back on Broadcom chips in favor of its in-house designs have added a little caution to the outlook, hinting at new risks to some parts of Broadcom’s business. It is a perfect snapshot of the push and pull shaping the stock’s story right now. Now here is where things get interesting: despite all the drama and dizzying long-term growth, Broadcom’s valuation score is currently sitting at 0 out of 6, based on our checklist of undervaluation signals. So is the stock expensive, or is there something the score does not capture? That is where digging deeper into valuation methods matters. In the end, I’ll share a perspective on valuation that makes even the strictest scorecard look incomplete. Broadcom scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in thefull valuation breakdown. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them back to their present value. This approach provides a perspective on whether a stock’s current price reflects its true long-term earning potential. For Broadcom, the latest trailing twelve months free cash flow (FCF) stands at approximately $24.8 billion. Analysts forecast robust growth, with FCF projected to climb significantly over the coming decade. While professional estimates extend to around five years, further projections from Simply Wall St suggest Broadcom could generate over $110 billion in free cash flow by 2035. Based on this aggressive growth scenario, the resulting intrinsic value per share is calculated at $225.23. However, compared to Broadcom's current share price, this implies the stock is about 49.0% overvalued according to the DCF model. In other words, Broadcom’s current market price is well above what discounted cash flow projections would suggest is fair value. Result: OVERVALUED Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Broadcom. Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Broadcom may be overvalued by 49.0%.Find undervalued stocksorcreate your own screenerto find better value opportunities. The Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a widely used metric for valuing profitable companies like Broadcom, since it gives investors a sense of how much they are paying for each dollar of earnings. For mature, established businesses with consistent earnings, the PE ratio quickly communicates how the market views their growth prospects and risk profile. It is important to remember that a higher PE ratio can be justified when a company is expected to deliver rapid earnings growth or if its operations carry less risk compared to peers. On the other hand, a lower PE ratio might reflect concerns over slowing growth or industry headwinds. In this context, Broadcom currently trades at a PE ratio of 84.2x, which is significantly higher than both the semiconductor industry average of 37.8x and its peer average of 53.5x. While industry comparisons are useful, Simply Wall St's ""Fair Ratio"" provides a more tailored perspective. The Fair Ratio blends factors like Broadcom’s earnings growth, profit margins, risk profile, industry conditions, and market capitalization to arrive at a benchmark of 60.9x for Broadcom. This makes it a more precise standard than simply using the industry or peer averages because it accounts for what makes Broadcom unique in its sector. Comparing Broadcom’s current PE of 84.2x to its Fair Ratio of 60.9x suggests the stock is priced well above what would be justified even after factoring in its strengths and outlook. Result: OVERVALUED PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?Discover companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth. Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is a simple, powerful tool that lets you build your own story about a company’s future by connecting reasons and expectations with numbers. Instead of just crunching standard models, Narratives allow you to state your view of Broadcom’s prospects, combine it with your assumptions about revenue, earnings, and margins, and see what fair value emerges. Narratives link the company’s story to a financial forecast and then to a personalized fair value. This lets you use both your own research and the latest market developments to decide whether Broadcom is a buy or a sell. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors find Narratives easy to use and update because they dynamically reflect news, earnings releases, and any shifts in the business environment. For example, if you believe AI demand and VMware integration will accelerate Broadcom’s growth, your Narrative might imply a high fair value (like $415.56 per share). If you are more cautious and see risks from high debt or rising competition, your Narrative might yield a much lower fair value (around $218.00 per share). Narratives make sense of valuation by using your perspective and the newest data combined. Do you think there's more to the story for Broadcom?Create your own Narrative to let the Community know!

AAPL,"At $1.2 Trillion, More High-Grade Debt Now Tied to AI Than Banks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-2-trillion-more-high-140538945.html,10/8/2025,"(Bloomberg) — The amount of debt tied to artificial intelligence has ballooned to $1.2 trillion, making it the largest segment in the investment-grade market, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). AI companies now make up 14% of the high-grade market from 11.5% in 2020, surpassing US banks, the largest sector on the JPMorgan US Liquid Index (JULI) index at 11.7%, JPMorgan analysts including Nathaniel Rosenbaum and Erica Spear wrote in a note Monday. Most Read from Bloomberg London’s ‘Superloop’ Buses Seek to Speed Suburban Commutes In Chicago, a Soft Architecture Biennial for Hard Times The analysts identified 75 companies across tech, utilities and capital goods sectors that are closely tied to AI, including Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) Many of these firms are prolific debt issuers and in the case of tech, they are cash rich with very low net debt. The cohort trades at 74 basis points, 10 basis points tighter than the broader JULI index, they said. Companies linked to AI have seen their equity valuations skyrocket since ChatGPT launched the modern AI era three years ago, as investors rush to get exposure to the technology that has the potential to shake-up the global economy. That’s sparked concerns that any setback in earnings from mega tech firms could trigger a broader selloff given their stretched valuations. “Debt tied to AI companies is growing fast but it trades tight for good reasons,” wrote the analysts. They noted that most of these companies are high-quality issuers, either cash rich or not highly levered and are likely highly regulated, which justifies their outperfomance. Debt investors are also scrambling to get a piece of the pie. Oracle’s (ORCL) $18 billion bond sale last month — the second-largest high-grade deal this year, garnered nearly $88 billion in investor demand. Banks and private credit firms have also been competing to underwrite debt deals supporting the development of large data centers. “The torrid ascent of AI stocks has caused some angst for credit investors worried that any potential downside there could have credit implications,” wrote the analysts. “From a fundamental perspective, these fears are not justified.” Still, an equity selloff in AI-related names would likely impact credit too, they added, given how tightly it’s trading. There is a risk if these companies use their pile of cash to fund capital expenditure or mergers and acquisitions ahead of debt redemption. “We think select shorts in CDS can make sense as a cheaper tail hedge for a cross-asset portfolio,” they said.

AAPL,Apple (AAPL): Downgrade Sparks Fresh Scrutiny of Valuation as iPhone Growth Projections Face Doubt,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-downgrade-sparks-fresh-135922119.html,10/8/2025,"Apple (AAPL) finds itself in the spotlight after Jefferies downgraded the stock, citing market expectations around upcoming iPhone models, particularly the potential for the iPhone 18 Fold, as being overly optimistic. The downgrade comes amid rising questions about Apple’s pricing power and demand trends for its most recent models. See our latest analysis for Apple. Despite the recent analyst downgrade and questions around Apple’s next iPhone cycle, the company continues to capture headlines—from a $131 billion shelf registration filing to ongoing leadership transitions and shifting AI strategy. While Apple’s share price has traded sideways lately, its 1-year total shareholder return of 16% hints that investors who took the long view have still been rewarded, even as near-term momentum cools and market nerves creep in about just how much future growth is already priced in. If Apple’s shifting dynamics have you watching tech giants more broadly, now’s an opportune time to discoverSee the full list for free. The recent wave of downgrades raises a critical question for prospective investors: does Apple’s stock offer hidden value under the surface, or have markets already priced in all of the company’s future growth potential? With Apple’s last close at $256.69 but a narrative-implied fair value of just $177.34, the gap in expectations is striking. According to Investingwilly, the financial underpinnings do not justify current market enthusiasm, especially as Apple’s growth slows. Apple’s P/E ratio currently exceeds 28x, far surpassing the broader market’s average of around 20x. For a company that is no longer experiencing explosive growth, such a high P/E ratio seems unsustainable. The market is pricing in continued rapid growth, but this assumption is increasingly unrealistic as Apple's product lines mature and market saturation sets in. Read the complete narrative. Do you want to uncover the driving assumption that makes this fair value so much lower than the market price? There is a sharp focus on slowing core business growth and the real sustainability of Apple’s profit margins, with one critical financial forecast changing the whole investment case.

Result: Fair Value of $177.34 (OVERVALUED) Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

AAPL,"Reform treasurer’s company seeking millions after alleged fraud, High Court told",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reform-treasurer-company-seeking-millions-120932514.html,10/8/2025,"Reform UK treasurer Nick Candy’s company is seeking millions in damages from a technology start-up which claimed to be the “next Facebook” following a “clear and straightforward case of fraud”, the High Court has been told. Candy Ventures Sarl (CVS), a portfolio of companies founded by Mr Candy, is taking legal action against Dutch businessman Robert Bonnier over allegations he “lied” to “deceive” it into investing around 7.5 million euro (£6.5 million) in Aaqua BV, which he directs. Mr Candy, who was announced as Reform’s treasurer in December last year, owns 90% of CVS. Barristers for the company told a trial on Tuesday that Mr Bonnier claimed Apple and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) were set to invest one billion US dollars in Aaqua, and as a result, CVS swapped shares in podcasting firm Audioboom for “worthless” shares in Aaqua. It is asking a court to rescind the investment or order Mr Bonnier and Aaqua to pay £5.7 million in damages. Mr Bonnier is representing himself at trial and in August was blocked from defending the claim for breaching court orders, with barristers for CVS telling the court he was “restricted to attendance and making oral submissions” and was “not allowed to advance any factual case”. He has told the court that while he “overstated the prospects of an investment” into Aaqua, he did not believe CVS would “rely” on it. In written submissions for the trial in London, Jonathan Nash KC, for CVS, said: “In late 2020/early 2021, Mr Bonnier lied to CVS, time and again, both orally and in writing, to deceive it into investing in his company, Aaqua. “He told CVS that he had discussed Aaqua with two of the world’s biggest names, Apple and LVMH, and believed that they would invest in the company.” He continued: “In fact, and as Mr Bonnier well knew, none of that was true.” He added: “As a result of his flagrant fraud, CVS, like other sophisticated investors, was duped into investing in Aaqua.” Mr Nash told the court Aaqua, which is now insolvent, was established in the Netherlands in 2020 to develop a “new social media software application”. Mr Bonnier is claimed to have told Mr Candy and Steven Smith, CVS’s executive director, that Apple and LVMH were set to invest in Aaqua, which Mr Smith told the court was “completely fundamental” to CVS’s decision to invest. Mr Candy met Mr Bonnier in Dubai in January 2021. Mr Nash claimed Mr Bonnier said he personally knew Apple chief executive Tim Cook and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, and told Mr Smith that Aaqua would be the “next Facebook”. CVS agreed in February 2021 to transfer 1.5 million shares in podcasting firm Audioboom to Aaqua, worth around £6.5 million. It also agreed to purchase 15,000 Aaqua shares, which were believed to be worth around 7.5 million euro (£6.5 million), but Mr Nash said the value of these was “false and artificial, induced, as it was, by Aaqua and Mr Bonnier’s fraud”. Following this, Mr Bonnier told Mr Candy on WhatsApp that Apple’s investment was “a foregone conclusion”, but the investment never occurred, Mr Nash said. Mr Nash said by the summer of 2022, “CVS’s patience had run out”, and when Mr Smith asked Mr Bonnier about the situation, he responded that he was “simply no longer comfortable talking about founder partner relationships”, with legal proceedings being launched that year. The barrister said Mr Bonnier had since said he had only met Mr Cook once, in 1999, and only met Mr Arnault at “large social gatherings”, adding Mr Bonnier knew his claims were false and “intended to mislead” CVS. The court was told Mr Bonnier claims he did not believe that Apple and LVMH’s supposed investment caused CVS to invest, which Mr Nash denied. Mr Nash said in court that Mr Bonnier claims he did not say Apple and LVMH were involved, and “all he did was express his aspiration that he could get Apple and LVMH on board”. But the barrister said the businessman “went much further than that”, stating: “What was said and what was said dishonestly, and what was highly material to my client’s view of this investment, was that there were active discussions with Apple and LVMH which could reasonably be expected to lead to investment.” In written submissions, Mr Bonnier admitted “selling his aspirations for Aaqua very enthusiastically, and occasionally perhaps going too far in those efforts”. But he said he had a “proven track record of ‘pulling off the impossible’ and creating substantial value for shareholders”. He said: “However, it was always understood that ultimately the claimant would form their own independent views on whether the founder’s vision would be achieved.” The Dutchman also said CVS had “expressly stated and agreed that it would conduct its own diligence on the specific point of the likelihood of an investment” by Apple and LVMH. He continued: “The claimant suffered no loss as a result of its investment; any loss it did suffer was brought about by the claimant’s own actions.” The trial before Mr Justice Bright is set to conclude later this week."

AAPL,How Klarna’s 10% Rally and Apple Pay Collaboration Shape Its 2025 Valuation Outlook,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/klarna-10-rally-apple-pay-130947400.html,10/8/2025,"Thinking about what to do with Klarna Group stock? You are not alone. Plenty of investors are eyeing the recent near double-digit bounce, with Klarna rising 9.9% over just the past week. That surge stands out against its year-to-date slip of -7.8%, hinting that shifting market sentiment is at play, possibly a change in risk appetite or confidence in Klarna’s digital payments platform. With fintech names regularly in the spotlight and sector developments unfolding, Klarna’s moves have grabbed attention for good reason. But before you decide your next move, let’s acknowledge the elephant in the room: Klarna’s valuation isn’t screaming “undervalued.” In fact, Klarna scores a 0 out of 6 on our value checklist, meaning it does not pass any of the standard undervaluation screens. Maybe that sounds blunt, but understanding why is crucial and could help you sidestep expensive mistakes, or spot some hidden upside others are overlooking. So, how do we figure out if the stock is truly worth its price? That is where different valuation approaches come into play. In this next section, we will break down these methods and what they can reveal about Klarna’s true worth. And stick around, there is an even smarter way to make sense of the numbers that we will hit at the end of this article. Klarna Group scores just 0/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in thefull valuation breakdown. The Excess Returns model evaluates whether a company is generating returns above its cost of equity, focusing on how profitably Klarna Group invests shareholder capital. In this method, the return on equity and growth of book value take center stage, offering insight into whether ongoing investments are creating long-term value for shareholders. For Klarna Group, the core numbers are: Book Value: $6.32 per share Stable EPS: $0.47 per share (Source: Weighted future Return on Equity estimates from 6 analysts.) Cost of Equity: $0.49 per share Excess Return: $-0.02 per share Average Return on Equity: 7.60% Stable Book Value: $6.15 per share (Source: Median Book Value from the past 5 years.) Based on these inputs, the Excess Returns model indicates Klarna’s intrinsic value is far lower than its current share price. Specifically, the discount implied by this model is a staggering 640.3 percent, meaning Klarna stock appears dramatically overvalued by this standard. The absence of substantial excess returns suggests the company is not generating enough profit over its cost of capital to justify its present valuation. Result: OVERVALUED Head to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for Klarna Group. Our Excess Returns analysis suggests Klarna Group may be overvalued by 640.3%.Find undervalued stocksorcreate your own screenerto find better value opportunities. The Price-to-Sales (PS) ratio is often the preferred multiple when valuing fintech companies like Klarna Group, especially when reported profits are volatile or inconsistent. Unlike earnings-based ratios, PS focuses on the company’s top-line revenue. This makes it a useful benchmark for businesses prioritizing growth or operating in competitive sectors where profitability can fluctuate from year to year. Growth prospects and risk appetite influence what investors consider a reasonable PS ratio. Higher expected growth typically justifies a higher multiple, while greater risks, thinner margins, or more competition generally pull the fair figure down. Comparing Klarna’s PS ratio to industry norms and similar companies can offer some context, but it does not capture the full picture on its own. Klarna’s current PS ratio stands at 5.30x, which is close to the peer group average of 5.24x and well above the Diversified Financial industry average of 2.86x. While these benchmarks are helpful, Simply Wall St’s proprietary Fair Ratio provides a more accurate view by evaluating Klarna’s growth outlook, profit margins, risk factors, and market cap in addition to broad sector statistics. Because the Fair Ratio considers the specifics of Klarna’s business model and prospects, it delivers a more tailored sense of value than raw comparisons against peers or the wider industry could offer. Based on this analysis, Klarna’s valuation using the PS multiple sits very close to its Fair Ratio, so the stock looks fairly valued by this approach. Result: ABOUT RIGHT PS ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?Discover companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth. Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is more than just numbers; it is your personal story or perspective about a company like Klarna Group, tying together your expectations for its future growth, earnings, and margins into a clear financial forecast and fair value estimate. Narratives make stock analysis approachable by linking what you believe about Klarna’s business to a data-driven valuation, letting you see how your view compares to the current share price. Available directly on Simply Wall St’s Community page, Narratives are used by millions of investors and are constantly updated as new news or earnings emerge, keeping your outlook fresh and relevant. With Narratives, you can easily spot if Klarna Group looks attractive to buy, or if it is time to consider selling, by comparing your fair value to the market price. For example, while one investor may see Klarna’s fair value as much higher based on bold growth assumptions, another may see it as much lower given concerns about profitability. This demonstrates just how powerful these personalized perspectives can be. Do you think there's more to the story for Klarna Group?Create your own Narrative to let the Community know!

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of theAI Stocks Investors Are Watching Closely.On October 3, Jefferies downgraded the stock to “Underperform” from Hold stating that expectations are too high for a foldable iPhone 18 for Apple. It also lowered its price target to $205.16 from $205.82. Analyst Edison Lee stated that the stock’s current valuation prices in an “overly bullish iPhone outlook.” “Better demand for iPhone 17, partly due to a price cut on the base model, is already in the price. That has led to excessive expectations on 18 Fold, and the replacement cycle.” Lee further stated that he is unclear how big of a market there would be for a phone that costs around $2,000. A price-driven replacement cycle is unlikely to be sustainable, particularly one without new features. This could in turn result in margin pressure. Photo byAlexandr BormotinonUnsplash The firm noted how the new iPhone Air, the thinnest iPhone yet, isn’t resonating well with customers which makes “any bullish view on foldable risky.” Apple is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.

AAPL,"Kentucky Governor Grapples With Tariffs, Says 2028 Call Can Wait",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kentucky-governor-grapples-tariffs-says-100000364.html,10/8/2025,"(Bloomberg) --The governor of one of America’s most trade-reliant states has a warning for President Donald Trump: Tariffs are hurting the industries he’s trying to revive. Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, one of a dying breed of red-state Democrats, is in his second-term running a manufacturing powerhouse in the US heartland — which now finds itself at the center of Trump’s policy shifts. Most Read from Bloomberg London’s ‘Superloop’ Buses Seek to Speed Suburban Commutes In Chicago, a Soft Architecture Biennial for Hard Times Kentucky bet big on electric cars, only to see the administration kill a key incentive. It’s welcomed major manufacturing investments, only for companies to face tariffs and the threat of immigration raids. And Beshear argues there’s more pain to come from Trump’s trade war. “The impacts are hitting the economy in Kentucky and across the country. They haven’t been fully felt yet,” he says in an interview in the state capital of Frankfort. “While Donald Trump says he wants to reshore American manufacturing, his tariffs are actually preventing it from occurring.” All that might explain why the Bluegrass State is home to three of the last prominent Republicans willing to buck Trump on tariffs and other issues — and to Beshear, who’s also grappling with his own party’s branding and how it can win back the White House. The 47-year-old, sometimes mentioned as a potential candidate in 2028, says any decision on whether to run is a long way off — while the threat from Trump’s tariffs is immediate and escalating. ‘Wait a Minute’ Kentucky ranked first in the nation last year for imports relative to its economy, and is among the top trading states overall. It’s a one-time coal giant turned manufacturing hub, with major auto and aerospace plants and, of course, its iconic bourbon. A bottle emblazoned with Beshear’s dog’s likeness sits on a shelf in his office at the Old Governor’s Mansion. Just above it sits Beshear’s own portrait, on a Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket. KFC might not be on the trade war’s front lines, but many of the state’s key industries are. Bourbon makers are facing boycotts — including in Canada, Kentucky’s top export market and a country in Trump’s crosshairs. Manufacturers like Ford Motor Co., which has a plant near Louisville, now face tariffs for inputs like steel and aluminum. Beshear says it’s the unpredictability of Trump’s tariff rollout that’s causing much of the trouble. “The only thing that doesn’t change is that it’s going to change every day,” he says. Industry experts aren’t being consulted, and “the president might think he’s helping domestic manufacturers, but in fact he’s hurting them.” Trump says taxing imports will encourage more local production, and points to a string of multi-billion-dollar investment pledges by big-name firms. Kentucky is getting its share: in recent months, Apple Inc. and GE Appliances have announced plans to expand production there. Still, Kentucky’s Chamber of Commerce echoes Beshear’s concern. The statewide economy is ripe for growth, says Kate Shanks, its senior vice president. But tariffs are “making businesses maybe think, well, let’s just wait a minute on what we want to expand and what we want to do.” When the 2028 presidential contest rolls around, there’ll likely be a sharp spotlight on America’s pivot to protectionism under Trump, and whether the Democratic contenders will pledge to reverse course. Trump’s first-term China tariffs drew plenty of criticism early on. By 2020, there was bipartisan consensus to keep them, which his successor Joe Biden largely did. Trump’s second-term tariffs are orders of magnitude bigger. They’re also bringing in lots of revenue for the federal government, something that typically appeals to politicians of all stripes. And the levies are not all unpopular. Beshear says some targeted duties can be useful — “steel and aluminum tariffs can make sense when done the right way” — and especially when aimed at adversaries like China that are hurting US industry by dumping their output. But he says the overall effect of ramping up trade barriers is harmful. “You don’t have to just believe me, the Democratic governor of Kentucky. Both of my Republican senators say that too.” Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul are outspoken critics of tariffs, as is Representative Thomas Massie, an occasional Trump critic whom the president is trying to unseat. “Put me down as a guy who hopes the trade war isn’t very long, because if it’s prolonged it means higher prices for all of you,” McConnell, who’s retiring after his term, said at a Kentucky Farm Bureau event in August. ‘Fight the Future’ For America’s auto giants, tariffs aren’t the only challenge. There’s also the looming question of the industry’s direction. Biden made a big bet on electric vehicles, while Trump has pulled back subsidies. Ford’s operations in Kentucky, which employ more than 13,000 workers all told, illustrate the two poles. The massive Kentucky Truck plant in Louisville builds highly profitable and gas-guzzling jumbo SUVs — the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition — as well as pickup trucks. Meanwhile, the company is spending $2 billion to build budget electric cars at the Louisville plant even though Ford lost $5.1 billion on its EV business last year and says this year could be worse. And 50 miles away in Glendale, Ford and its partner SK On of South Korea began producing batteries for the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck in August. Their joint venture – known as BlueOvalSK — got a big loan from Biden’s Department of Energy, but is now searching for customers amid the EV slowdown. Beshear signals full support for the electric revolution. “A lot of people have tried to fight the future, and no one’s ever won,” he says. “EVs are where the world is going.” With multiple South Korean firms producing in Kentucky, as well as Japanese auto giant Toyota, Beshear says he’s not comfortable with the kind of metrics Trump invokes to support his America-first approach. “To me, trade policy is a lot more complicated than how many American cars are in Japan or vice versa,” he says. ‘Chaos and Cruelty’ Kentucky’s investors in particular are facing potential uncertainty on another front after the high-profile immigration raid in Georgia last month, which saw hundreds of Korean workers detained and sent home. It sparked a diplomatic furor, leading South Korea’s president to say it’s now “difficult to invest in the US” and warning that joint ventures risk getting stalled. Trump has since acknowledged the need for major projects to have some clarity around visas for foreign workers, especially trainers. Beshear says that as far as he knows, “all investments in Kentucky are proceeding.” About the conduct of the Georgia raid, he says: “What I saw was a lack of humanity and respect in how we enforced our immigration laws that day.” He wraps his critiques of how immigration and trade policies have been rolled out into a phrase that almost sounds like a campaign slogan for someone running against Trump’s record: “He’s governed with chaos and cruelty.” Whether Beshear will make such a run remains to be seen. McConnell, who served for years as the top Senate Republican, predicted that Democrats would press him to run for the Senate instead. He told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Beshear was a “gifted politician” but a long-shot in 2028. The Kentucky governor was considered when former Vice President Kamala Harris was picking a running mate. He now offers a diagnosis of why Trump beat her – as well as a description of the kind of nominee the party needs next time, whether it’s him or someone else. “The Democratic Party has lost the faith of working people that we are focused on them,” Beshear says. He thinks Trump was victorious in part because he won over undecided voters on that measure, while “the vice president was distracted by a lot of other issues.” “I’m trying to be a common-sense, common-ground, get-things-done type of voice,” he adds. The Democrats need a candidate who can bridge divides, and “if we think I’m that candidate, I’ll consider it.” Some of the more prominent Democratic governors expected to seek the nomination, such as California’s Gavin Newsom — an early frontrunnner in the betting markets — and JB Pritzker of Illinois, have already become targets of Trump’s attacks. Beshear is the incoming chair of the Democratic Governors Association, and says for now he’s focused on scoring some victories for his cohort in midterm elections that are just over a year away. “I’ve got 36 races, and let me tell you, we’re gonna change the map,” he says. “We’re gonna win in some places that nobody’s expecting. And then after that, we’ll see.” --With assistance from Keith Naughton, Mark Niquette and Gabrielle Coppola.
