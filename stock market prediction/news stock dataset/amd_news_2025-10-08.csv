AMD,What's driving the latest bout of AI deals? Analyst answers.,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-driving-latest-bout-ai-213000938.html,2025-10-08,"Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Futurum CEO Daniel Newman discuss the AI milestones that could push Big Tech companies and hyperscalers even farther, includingmeeting compute capacity and demands, amid the latest round ofartificial intelligence deals and partnerships. Also catch Daniel Newman and Patrick Moorhead weigh in onwhether bubbles are forming in the AI trade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat? Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them. I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility. On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this. I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value. What do you make of that, Dan? These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future. They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future. The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future. And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out. The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold. So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend. But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."
AMD,"AMD, Brinker International, Dollar Tree: Top Analyst Calls",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-brinker-international-dollar-tree-142339990.html,2025-10-08,"Yahoo Finance senior reporterAllie Canalkeeps track of several Wall Street analyst calls on top trending stocks, including calls around shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) after the AI chip developer announced a partnership with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), Chili's and Maggiano's parent company Brinker International (EAT), and Dollar Tree (DLTR). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Catalysts. Let's turn now to some of today's top analyst calls on Wall Street. Let's kick things off with AMD. Shares extending their gain after Jeffries turned more bullish on the chipmaker. The firm upgrading shares to buy from hold and boosting its price target to 300 bucks a share. That's nearly 50% upside from Monday's close. The call comes on the heels of that new Open AI partnership, which Jeffries called a quote strong validation of AMD's AI roadmap and a signal of just how deep demand runs for these advanced chips. The firm estimates this deal could generate over $100 billion in revenue from Open AI and other customers over the next four years. Next up, Brinker International. The company behind Chili is getting a lift from J.P. Morgan. The bank upgrading the stock to overweight from neutral, calling valuations too low and saying investors are too fixated on short-term difficult compares. J.P. Morgan making the case that Brinker has what it takes for Chili's to recapture decades of lost traffic and drive a longer-term turnaround story. Shares are down about 4% since the start of the year. And finally, shares of Dollar Tree falling this morning after Jeffries cut its stock rating to underperform from hold, citing a tougher landscape for the discount retailer. The analyst said inflation, management decisions, and new tariffs have turned a simple business model into a complex one. Add in rising competition from Walmart and margins look set to stay under pressure. Well, that's it. Keep it right here on Yahoo Finance. We'll be tracking all the market moves throughout the session."
AMD,"Chip rally lifts markets, but Citi warns of profit-taking risk",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chip-rally-lifts-markets-citi-132733721.html,2025-10-08,"US stock futures (ES=F,NQ=F,YM=F) inched higher ahead of Tuesday's opening bell, led by chipmaker stocks. In particular,AMD(AMD) stock is extending gains whileNvidia(NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) stocks also rise. Citi analysts warn that the tech-driven rally may pull back, saying ""profit-taking risks have rapidly risen."" Yahoo Finance Senior ReporterAllie Canalexamines the latest market moves. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. There's a lot of questions about is it a bubble? And then stocks keep going up. Yeah, higher highs is what they say, Julie. And if you take a look at the chip sector, I mean AMD closed Monday's session up 23%. It's up another 5% early this morning. You have Micron up around 3%, TSMC up nearly 2%. and even Nvidia and Broadcom, those are two names that fell on Monday due to that increased competition between AMD and Open AI. You are seeing modest gains shortly before the opening bell. So this tells you that there's still that optimism there. You were talking about some of the bubble risks and we've been hearing from a variety of strategists on the street. Ed Yardeni raising his price target back to 7,000 for year end for the S&P 500. Evercore ISI Julian Emanuel assigning a 30% chance of a bubble scenario where by the end of 2026, you could see 9,000 for the S&P 500. But City was also out with a new note that warning there could be some profit taking. Uh analysts talked about how there's bullish positioning across US markets, especially in big tech and small caps. and that is now stretched. It has something called the Levkovich uh sentiment index and that remains well into euphoric territory. Now, typically when that happens, forward returns have historically turned negative. and that exuberance is being echoed elsewhere. Goldman Sachs reports that client sentiment is at its highest level since December. Uh, Barkley's has a tracker that says firmly in exuberant territory, yet we're still seeing these consistent record highs and investors are also looking ahead to earning season which kicks off in just a few days to see if we can sustain that. So really shrugging off a lot of these macro risks and focusing on that AI story here."
AMD,AMD CEO Lisa Su says AI critics are 'thinking too small' after massive OpenAI deal,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-ceo-lisa-su-says-ai-critics-are-thinking-too-small-after-massive-openai-deal-202818700.html,2025-10-08,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su says it's time for the tech world to think bigger about artificial intelligence. ""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" Su told Yahoo Finance on Monday when asked about concerns that massive AI investments may be getting ahead of themselves. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world."" Su said the company is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded."" Shares of AMD rose 4% before the bell on Tuesday, having jumped by as much as 35% on Monday after the companyannounceda multibillion-dollar partnership with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). It's one of the largest infrastructure deals to date. It will see AMD supply up to 6 gigawatts of GPUs to the ChatGPT maker over several years, starting with its upcoming MI450 chips in the second half of 2026. Under the agreement, AMD also issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company. Shares will vest in stages as AMD hits milestones, beginning once the company deploys its first 1 gigawatt of chips. Su said the deal could generate ""tens of billions of dollars"" in revenue for AMD over the next few years. Additionally, the agreement culminates years-long discussions with OpenAI. The news comes on the heels of Nvidia's (NVDA) own $100 billion bet on OpenAI, underscoring the escalating race to build out AI infrastructure. Nvidia has also announced a $5 billion investment in Intel (INTC) to co-develop data centers and PC products. AMD has spent the past two years trying to chip away at Nvidia's AI GPU dominance. Nvidia commands roughly90% of the market. Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about AMD's OpenAI deal. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley said the structure — which includes stock warrants triggered by milestones and a $600 share price target — ""is designed to be mutually beneficial,"" but is also aimed at ""driving the stock higher."" He estimates the deal could add $18 billion in annual revenue and $3 per share in quarterly earnings per share by 2030 if deployment progresses as expected. Citi analyst Atif Malik noted the announcement also benefits other AI ecosystem players, including Astera Labs (ALAB), which supplies networking infrastructure tied to AMD's new Helios platform. ""We see the news positively for ALAB as it is a leader in open AI networking ecosystems,"" Malik wrote, calling Helios a ""key catalyst"" for the broader AI hardware landscape. Looking ahead, Su said the AI boom is still in its early innings. ""I really believe that this is the beginning of a 10-year kind of supercycle,"" she said, adding that the potential for AI to transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research, is only starting to unfold. ""We believe with the proper use of AI compute, you can solve diseases faster. You can do much faster drug discovery. You can do much better in terms of diagnosing issues that people have early on and that makes ... a personal difference in people's lives,"" she said.

AMD,The stakes of OpenAI's dealmaking,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stakes-of-openais-dealmaking-100018146.html,2025-10-08,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The Chart of the Day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings OpenAI is on a dealmaking tear. First it wasOracleandNvidia. Then, on Monday,AMD joined the OpenAI partnership party, in a multibillion-dollar collaboration with the maker of ChatGPT. Chipmaker and Nvidia rival AMD will provide upward of 6 gigawatts of GPUs to OpenAI over several years. And OpenAI will take a roughly 10% stake in the company. AMD shares soared more than 30%, underscoring how highly the market values OpenAI's ambitions and the fortune-making potential ofthe AI buildout. But OpenIA's burst of partnerships also underscores the stakes for a company going all in on superintelligence. However investors and analysts see OpenAI's leadership in AI — whether that's at the top of the pedestal or near it — one thing Sam Altman doesn't have is a profitable business that predates the recent LLM mania. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy As DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients Friday, ""If all the enthusiasm over Generative Artificial investment is going to hit a pothole soon, it will almost certainly not be because of financial results at US Big Tech firms."" The massive investments tech giants are doling out on AI are still operating within their limits of operating cash flows and commitments to shareholders, he noted. OpenAI, in other words, is vulnerable in ways its tech giant rivals are not. Yes, OpenAI claims the top two apps in the App Store rankings right now. That standing reflects user excitement for its new video generation tool Sora and the sustained interest in its flagship product ChatGPT. The flurry of agreements also showcasesAltman's strategic approachanda circular, incestuous style of dealmakingthat shrewdly places chipmaking rivals in the business of advancing his business. Both offensive and defensive at once, OpenAI's intertwining makes it, if not ""too big to fail,"" about as close as it could be. But for all the shrewdness and ambition, there is no fallback plan or alternative revenue stream. OpenAI doesn't have a sprawling social media network or a global advertising machine; it doesn't (yet) have a world-class hardware lineup with an ecosystem of users that exceeds a billion. There is no e-commerce platform. No cloud storage empire. Name your tech giant business unit and OpenAI doesn't have it. That's not to say that startups shouldn't bother to trailblaze a new market. But the ability of the tech giants to spend vast fortunes on their future, while maintaining profitability, is something no amount of dealmaking can manufacture. On the other hand, if AI truly succeeds as the companies and investors anticipate, we may all forget what Microsoft used to sell. After all, only a few years ago, Nvidia was a graphics card company.

AMD,"Intel to reveal tech details on forthcoming PC chip, sources say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-reveal-tech-details-forthcoming-225159709.html,2025-10-08,"By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel (INTC) plans to release technical details about its forthcoming chip for laptops, known as Panther Lake, on Thursday, four sources briefed on the plans told Reuters. It is part of an effort to reassure investors about Intel's first product made entirely using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A, the sources said. The Panther Lake chips are the company's high-end mobile processors that are typically included in more expensive laptops and are the first high-volume Intel products to use the 18A process that the company has spent billions developing. In part because of manufacturing stumbles, Intel has steadily ceded laptop and PC market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices. Panther Lake represents an opportunity to reverse some of the losses. The company conducted hours of technical briefings and factory tours in Arizona for industry analysts last week on the new Panther Lake microarchitecture, including detailed explanations of the graphics and central processor cores and its media engine, according to the sources. Intel revealed a redesigned AI engine and the company's efficiency and performance processor cores, which were redesigned for the 18A manufacturing process. The last-generation laptop chip called Lunar Lake was primarily made by Intel rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel executives have said the Panther Lake chips will be available early in 2026, according to the sources. The new chips use 30% less energy than the prior generation, and its graphics and central processors will receive a 50% boost in their ability to crunch data in some situations, according to a second source briefed on the chips. The technical briefings conducted last week for a group of analysts and journalists underscored the importance of Panther Lake's success to Intel, which has struggled to manufacture the cutting-edge chips. An Intel spokesperson said the company holds technical briefings in the autumn most years on various topics but declined to comment further. In July, the chipmaker reported a second-quarter loss of $2.9 billion and disclosed that if it did not secure a customer for its planned future 14A manufacturing process, it would suspend work on it. After U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpcalled for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in August, Intel attracted investments from SoftBank Group andNvidia. After Tan met with Trump and other officials in the White House, the administration worked out a deal to transform a CHIPS Act grant into a 9.9% equity stake in the company. Last week, as part of the briefings, Intel conducted a tour for reporters and industry analysts of its factories in Arizona, including one called Fab 52, the people said. Intel broke ground on Fab 52 in 2021 as part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's multibillion-dollar global expansion plan to compete with TSMC in the contract manufacturing business. Fab 52 houses Intel's 18A in-house manufacturing process, which includes a new transistor design and a method of delivering energy to the chip more efficiently. The tour aimed to demonstrate Intel's manufacturing prowess and show off the chip factory, or fab, that it will use for high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake chips. Reuters did not attend this tour. Intel executives did not discuss the current Panther Lake yields, or the number of good chips that Intel is capable of producing, according to the people. Reuters reported in August that over the summer the Panther Lake yield was roughly 10%, up from 5% late last year. (Reporting by Max A. Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

AMD,Wall Street analysts explain how AMD’s own stock will pay for OpenAI’s billions in chip purchases,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-explain-amd-210019915.html,2025-10-08,"After AMD and OpenAI announced anexpanded partnership on Monday, thechatterimmediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 apiece,AMD disclosed. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement. If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about $100 billion. “We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday. But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases. Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs. So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and institutional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investmentannounced last month. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% market share, USB estimates — into one of thebiggest build-outsof next-generation data centers the world has ever seen. While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.”"
AMD,Dizzying deal delirium: How the AI bubble bursts,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dizzying-deal-delirium-ai-bubble-205337503.html,2025-10-08,"So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, whileNvidiais investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also countsMicrosoftas one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoftaccountedfor almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su hasdefendedAMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said heexpectsthere to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.”Amazonfounder and executive chairman Jeff Bezoscalledthe current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI,warnedthat “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reportsestimatethat AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalestnotesthat “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanovapoints outthat after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreakingreport from Applesuggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” Arecent studyfrom MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations consideredhad achieved zero returnon investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently aftertelling Axios,“AI could wipe outhalfof all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy atMcKinsey& Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbookreportedthat nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23%in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such asAndreessenHorowitzandY Combinator, on AI startups and themindbogglingvaluationsof those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft,Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI iscommittedto investing $300 billion in computing power withOracleover the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation hasalmost doubledfrom $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recentreportingby CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Anotherreportsays the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk haveeach raised concernsabout the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model,provided a recent exampleof what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is notdifficult to imaginea major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerfulWashington Postop-ed, Bethany McLeanpoignantly recallsthe overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classicExtraordinaryPopularDelusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs ofFortune.

Stock indexes gave up an early advance on Tuesday and turned lower as most chipmakers retreated following Monday's surge.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 initially rallied to new all-time highs on Tuesday, driven by strength in chipmakers and AI infrastructure stocks.  Advanced Micro Devices rose more than +3% Tuesday, adding to Monday's +23% surge due to the spending boom in artificial intelligence.

Optimism that growth in the AI sector and spending on artificial intelligence will translate into corporate profits is a major bullish factor for stocks.  Stocks are also underpinned by hopes that a resilient US economy and additional Fed easing will continue to support the economy. US Aug consumer credit rose by +$0.363 million, weaker than expectations of +$14.000 billion and the smallest increase in six months. Hawkish Fed comments were negative for stocks.  Monday evening, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said, ""With inflation still too high, monetary policy should lean against demand growth to allow the space for supply to grow and relieve price pressures in the economy."" On Tuesday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said, ""Some of the data we're looking at is sending some stagflationary signals,"" and that any drastic cuts to interest rates would risk stoking inflation. The shutdown of the US government is now into its second week, weighing on market sentiment and delaying key economic reports.  The government shutdown means delays in the release of government reports, including Tuesday's international trade data for August and last Friday's monthly payroll report.  A prolonged shutdown could also delay the government's inflation data, scheduled for release on October 15.  The White House has warned that if the government shutdown lingered, it would trigger widespread dismissals of employees in government programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities.  Bloomberg Economics estimates that 640,000 federal workers will be furloughed during a shutdown, which would expand jobless claims and push the unemployment rate up to 4.7%. The ongoing US government shutdown, expectations of additional Fed easing, and political uncertainty in France and Japan are also driving investors to haven assets, such as gold and Bitcoin.  Gold prices edged up to another record high on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs raised its gold price forecast for 2026 to $4,900 an ounce from $4,300, citing ETF inflows and central bank buying.  According to the latest data, the People's Bank of China added to its gold holdings in September for an eleventh consecutive month. Market focus this week will be on any new developments regarding tariffs, trade, or attempts by lawmakers to end the ongoing US government shutdown.  On Wednesday, the minutes of the September 16-17 FOMC meeting will be released.  On Thursday, Fed Chair Powell will give welcoming remarks at a Fed Community Bank Conference.  On Friday, the University of Michigan Oct consumer sentiment index is expected to fall -1.1 to 54.0. Rising corporate earnings expectations are a bullish backdrop for stocks.  According to Bloomberg Intelligence, more than 22% of companies in the S&P 500 provided guidance for their Q3 earnings results that are expected to beat analysts' expectations, the highest in a year.  However, Q3 profits are expected to have risen by +7.2%, the smallest increase in two years.  Also, Q3 sales growth is projected to slow to 5.9% from 6.4% in Q2. The markets are pricing in a 93% chance of a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on Oct 28-29. Overseas stock markets on Tuesday settled mixed.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.27%.  China's Shanghai Composite did not trade and is closed for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rose to a new record high and closed up +0.01%. Interest Rates December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Tuesday closed up by +9 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield fell -2.5 bp to 4.127%.  Dec T-notes recovered from a 1-week low on Tuesday, and the 10-year T-note yield fell from a 1-week high of 4.175%.  T-notes are supported by the ongoing US government shutdown, which could add to job losses and weaken the US economy, allowing the Fed to continue cutting interest rates.  T-notes also found support from Tuesday's slide in equity markets.  T-notes raced to their highs Tuesday afternoon on strong demand for the Treasury's $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.66, better than the 10-auction average of 2.60. T-notes initially moved lower Tuesday on hawkish Fed comments.  Kansas City Fed President Schmid said policymakers need to keep pressing against inflation, which has remained stubbornly high, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari warned that any drastic cuts to interest rates would risk stoking inflation.  Supply pressures are also undercutting T-note prices as the Treasury will auction $119 billion of T-notes and T-bonds this week. European government bond yields finished lower on Tuesday.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -0.9 bp at 2.709%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 1-week high of 4.758% and finished down by -1.6 bp to 4.719%. German Aug factory orders unexpectedly fell -0.8% m/m, weaker than expectations of +1.2% m/m. Swaps are discounting a 1% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on October 30. US Stock Movers Chip makers and AI infrastructure stocks gave up early gains on Tuesday and sold off, weighing on the broader market.  Seagate Technology Holdings (STX) closed down more than -6% to lead losers in the S&P 500.  Also, Lam Research (LRCX) closed down more than -6%, and Applied Materials (AMAT) closed down more than -5%.  In addition, KLA Corp (KLAC), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI), and ON Semiconductor Corp (ON) closed down more than -4%, and Analog Devices (ADI) and ASML Holding NV (ASML) closed down more than -3%.  Finally, GlobalFoundries (GFS), Micron Technology (MU), Marvell Technology (MRVL), and Microchip Technology (MCHP) closed down more than -2%.

Ford Motor (F) closed down more than -6% after the Wall Street Journal reported the company faces months of disruptions to its business after a major fire at an aluminum plant in New York.

AMD,Why Tesla (TSLA) Shares Are Sliding Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-tsla-shares-sliding-201044634.html,2025-10-08,"Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 3.3% in the afternoon session after the company unveiled a more affordable, stripped-down version of its Model Y, which disappointed investors who had hoped for an entirely new vehicle. The move followed a 5.5% gain in the previous trading session, which was fueled by speculation over a teased product launch. However, the reveal of cheaper versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively, was met with less enthusiasm. The new variants were seen as a move to revive demand after the expiration of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September. Also, a confluence of negative economic data pointed to a weak economy. The latest Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Fed revealed that households' short-term inflation expectations are rising, while their outlook on the labor market is deteriorating. Consumers expressed greater concern about potential job losses and expect lower earnings growth, factors that directly impact discretionary spending. Adding to the unease, Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, warned that 22 states are already showing clear signs of a recession, placing the broader U.S. economy in a precarious position. The ongoing U.S. government shutdown further dampens sentiment, threatening to weigh on incomes and purchasing power. The shares closed the day at $432.92, down 4.5% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunties to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Tesla?Access our full analysis report here. Tesla’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 48 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was a day ago when the stock gained 3.9% on the news that the company teased an event scheduled for October 7, sparking investor speculation about the potential unveiling of a new, more affordable electric vehicle. The tease appeared in a short video posted on social media, showing a vehicle's headlights in a dark setting, fueling anticipation for the announcement. Analysts speculated that Tesla might unveil a lower-cost version of its Model Y, which was viewed as a pivotal move to sustain sales momentum amid rising competition. Tesla is up 14.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $433.91 per share, it is still trading 9.6% below its 52-week high of $479.86 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $3,061.

AMD,"These Stocks Score From AMD's OpenAI Deal, Wall Street Analysts Say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-score-amds-openai-deal-195557299.html,2025-10-08,"HECTOR RETAMAL / AFP / Getty Images Wall Street analysts highlighted Super Micro Computer, Dell Technologies and Astera Labs as some of the stocks that could gain from an OpenAI deal with Advanced Micro Devices. Several analysts suggested AMD's deal could be taken as a positive signal for the semiconductor sector and AI trade broadly, though they pointed to some of AMD's networking partners as more direct beneficiaries. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has a number of partners that could be set to benefit from itsbig deal with OpenAI, according to Wall Street analysts. The ChatGPT maker committed to buying several generations of AMD's AI chips, sending shares of the semiconductor firm up 24% yesterday and another 4% on Tuesday. The announcement also boosted shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Astera Labs (ALAB), Dell Technologies (DELL), and others that have business with AMD. J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see current AMD partners and AI server makers Supermicro, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) as poised to gain from the deal. They also highlighted Arista Networks (ANET) and Sanmina (SANM), which earlier this year agreed to buy ZT Systems’ Data Center Infrastructure manufacturing business from AMD and became a preferred manufacturing partner as part of the agreement. Several analysts suggested AMD's deal could be taken as a positive signal for the semiconductor sector and AI trade broadly, though they pointed to some of AMD's networking partners as more direct beneficiaries. The deal underscores the wide-ranging impact of the surge in AI demand on companies and stocks, with analysts likening the AI boom to a rising tide that lifts all boats. ""While the announcements till date from OpenAI have largely focused on tight partnerships with semiconductor companies, we expect to see similar partnerships with Hardware and Networking companies as critical to scaling infrastructure,"" J.P. Morgan said. Citi analysts said they see AMD's OpenAI agreement as presenting a positive read-through for memory chip makerMicron Technology(MU) and Astera Labs as well. Astera, which supplies connectivity solutions for AI data centers and counts Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD as customers, saw its stock pop 10% Monday, before pulling back Tuesday.
