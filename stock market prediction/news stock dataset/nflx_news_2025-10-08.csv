To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. All right, now time for some of today's trending tickers. Aptis Capital Advisors, David Wagner joining me here for a look at Trilogy Metals. We'll talk a little Netflix, some IBM. David, it's good to see you. So, um, let's start with Trilogy Metals. Those shares uh soaring. Look at that move as the Trump administration takes a 10% stake in in the company. Um, remember this is of course a minerals explorer. Bloomberg has a write up here noting this is part of a of a nearly $36 million investment, David, secure critical energy, mining projects in Alaska. And we have seen this sort of broader strategy, right? So we had last week, US agreed to acquire direct investment in Lithium Americas, right? Then over the summer, David, you remember, US agreed to a that was a $400 million equity investment in MP materials for the plant for for rare earths. What what do you make of this? Yeah, you know, Josh, one, thanks for having me. But it's all becoming, you know, for us, the United States becoming more dependent on ourselves, not the rest of the world. And what we've learned about this uh Ambler road that's needed to be built. It's a 211-mile road that needs to be built to be able to get to basically this copper mine. I mean, me and you know both that copper is basically the number one factor that we need to look at as investors that could presage, you know, manufacturing overall from an industrial standpoint, from a construction standpoint, but most importantly, a technological standpoint. I mean copper is so important to that industry, specifically on semiconductors. And in this race for AI, you know, we know Donald Trump, he he kind of wants to become his own Francisco de Arconio, the one of the main protagonists in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Obviously he was in Chile, we're talking about Alaska now, but Trump, he absolutely knows that there's so many amazing basic resources up in Alaska and we need to finally tap them and this is kind of one of the last legs, this last road that needs to be put in place so we can go after this copper. All right, turning now uh to a different name here, Netflix. That stock getting a lift over at Seaport as the firm upgrade shares from neutral to buy. They are believers, David. Um the upgrade to buy. We note they say continued year over year market share gains versus linear, uh continued professional curated content they talk about, driving engagement leadership, stock momentum has has recently stalled, but they say it could reflect some, you know, just digesting gains. Ahead they say of the advertising infrastructure built related monetization momentum. Their target is 1385. Seaport not alone, which you mentioned, I mean most on the street who cover this name tell clients you should be buying it. It it's the bell weather in the space. It's either you own Netflix or anyone else and you're going to want to own the bell weather here. I mean, David Joyce, he he's the analyst over there at Seaport. Known him a long time, very smart guy. He's he's had a lot of great calls with this name. But you hit the the nail on the head there. It's all about operating leverage in regard to its overall advertising spending. And right now, at least per per Seaport, they're expecting an annualized growth rate on the advertising side of 48% over the next five years into 2030. I mean, I get it. The the the knock on the stock is always going to be valuation. But let me let me say that again, it's always going to be valuation. So, I'm a big believer of price is what you pay, value is what you get here. And you're kind of going to get like that Amazon effect there because Amazon obviously got a big boost which helped their operating leverage on the advertising side of things. And you saw them grow into their multiple. I mean, we're we're pricing Netflix right now at 40 times forward earnings. I mean, if you look at Seaport's projections, you know, out in 2030 and that's what they think that investors should be looking at too because that's the advertising story. Like you get an earnings per share of 30 times. And to be quite honest, uh you know, that name alongside the Magnificent 7, if you can get that core characteristic of operating leverage, I think 30 times is is a pretty good deal. Do you look at, I mean some would argue the streaming wars is over, Netflix is king, everybody's just battling for second place. Now of course, there's a lot of potential money in second place. Is that how you see it? I I would say yes. And I think this has been something like 10 years in the making for for for Netflix because they have a such a very much different model than all of their other peers. All of their other peers, it's all on the CAPEX number. How much money are we spending on new content? I mean, that was a story for Netflix for a long period of time. That was a story for for Disney still to this day. But they have so many other partnerships out there where they can diversify their revenue streams and more importantly, diversify their costs, which benefits their their operating leverage from a bottom line approach where they kind of are the only name in town right now. And then the kicker is obviously the international growth story. All right, last one I want you to take on IBM. Let's talk about Big Blue. Partnering up with Anthropic on enterprise software development. So this one, David, um, listen, yes, OpenAI, of course, has been has been making deals, but they aren't the only game in town. Now, IBM's saying, um it will integrate Anthropic's AI tech into its software. It's going to make its cloud family of LLMs, large language models, accessible for clients. Uh by the way, Baron's reminding us IBM open to to uh to OpenAI as well. Those two had had also collaborated earlier, but it does seem like investors, you you throw an AI strategic partnership out of there and the stock moves. That was going to be my first point here. It's all about partnerships. You're either partnering and growing or you're not yeah, absolutely, you're partnering and becoming obsolete in some type of way. I mean, IBM's been a great company for for quite some time. I'm not surprised by the action today because it's what, the stock's up maybe 1 or 2%. This is not a game-changing deal whatsoever. It's kind of more of a nuts and bolts type of uh integration in my mind because obviously with with Claude and Anthropic, you're really trying to tap into the intellectual property of IBM because especially on their consulting side, they kind of have the best lens into how Gen AI is being adopted across a cohort or slew of different industries. And so to be able to get your leg in the door with IBM to get that data and information, especially on the security side of things and on the compliance side of things, I I think it was a smart partnership."
NFLX,Why Jim Cramer thinks the stock market isn't loved,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-jim-cramer-thinks-the-stock-market-isnt-loved-125154580.html,2025-10-08,"Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid Unfiltered onApple Podcasts,Amazon Music,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. While Warren Buffettsaid,“our favorite holding period is forever,” occasional investor skittishness is nothing new. Yet has it gone to extremes? Despite solid stock market performance this year, “I think that we’re in a period where people are not sure about capitalism,” ""Mad Money"" hostJim Cramertold Yahoo Finance'sBrian Sozzion a new episode of theOpening Bid Unfilteredpodcast (see video above; listen below). “I do believe we’re still stuck with what happened in 2000 and 2008, which were both horrendous,” he continued. “Although if you held on to the Mercks of the world, you ended up doing fine.” Cramer has sat in the host chair of ""Mad Money"" for nearly two decades and is the author of several books, including the recently published ""How to Make Money in Any Market."" He has studied markets and worked to demystify them for the average investor. He was one of the first to call out Nvidia (NVDA) — “my best pick” — when it was just a gaming company. He also had a hand in coining the acronym FAANG (Facebook, now Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG), now Alphabet (GOOGL). Save the date for Yahoo Finance's BIG Invest event! “FAANG was the greatest creator of wealth in my life other than Nvidia, and I think my job was to find great stocks,” Cramer said. “But I wanted people to understand why I thought they were great.” For many young investors, crypto and the hot stocks of the moment often crowd out the more traditional names and advice, leaving them susceptible to more volatile investments. “Compounding is so boring,” Cramer said. “People think it’s too hard. They don’t understand what the P/E means. They don’t understand what it means to buy and hold a great stock.” This shorter-term thinking contrasts withBuffett’s sentimenton the stock market.

In that report, analysts expect Netflix to post earnings of $6.88 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 27.41%. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $11.52 billion, reflecting a 17.3% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.

NFLX,Why Netflix (NFLX) Stock Is Up Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-netflix-nflx-stock-today-201042468.html,2025-10-08,"Shares of streaming video giant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) jumped 2.6% in the afternoon session after Seaport Research Partners upgraded the stock to 'Buy' from 'Neutral', pointing to significant growth potential in the company's advertising business. The firm also increased its price target for the stock to $1,385. The upgrade was based on the belief that Netflix was positioned for a major boom in its advertising operations and could better monetize its platform. Analysts at Seaport argued that after years of building the required infrastructure, Netflix could double its ad revenue to $3.1 billion this year. They also projected that this revenue stream could expand to as much as $16 billion by 2030. This optimistic view followed a period where the company's stock had pulled back from its recent highs. The shares closed the day at $1,192, up 2.4% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Netflix?Access our full analysis report here. Netflix’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 7 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago when the stock gained 15.4% on the news that the company reported impressive fourth-quarter results, which blew past analysts' global streaming paid memberships expectations, with a strong net add figure (18.9 million vs. estimates of 9.8 million). This led to a revenue and EPS beat in the quarter. Additionally, revenue guidance for 2025 beat expectations, and the company spoke optimistically about multiple vectors such as ad revenue, live events, and new content. Netflix's decision to increase pricing on certain subscription plans also reflected management's confidence in its content's quality and suggested potential benefits for both sales and profitability. Overall, this quarter was strong. Following the strong performance, Barclays upgraded the stock's rating from Sell to Hold, adding, ""The company's continued outperformance largely disproves our hypothesis on growth mean reversion and while growth will slow in '25, current operating momentum if sustained, could drive further upside."" Netflix is up 34.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $1,192 per share, it is still trading 11% below its 52-week high of $1,339 from June 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Netflix’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,229. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

OpenAI's plans to buy six gigawatts of AMD equipment changes the company's ""AI narrative,"" the firm tells investors in a research note. JPMorgan upgradedBrinker(EAT)to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $175, down from $180. The firm believes casual dining should benefit from low supply growth, value messaging, and tax benefits in 2026. TD Cowen upgradedVeeva(VEEV)to Buy from Hold with a price target of $380, up from $297. The company is well positioned to post sales growth above consensus estimates due to multiple drivers, including the secular shift to large pharma insourcing and the Iqvia(IQV)partnership, the firm tells investors in a research note.

Citi downgradedGE HealthCare(GEHC)to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $83, down from $93, ahead of the Q3 report.

JPMorgan downgradedSynchrony(SYF)to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $75, down from $80, as part of a Q3 earnings preview. The firm recommends the ""relative defensiveness"" of the general-purpose credit card issuers over Synchrony, which it says has a potentially lower position in the consumer payment hierarchy and higher delinquency rates. Stephens downgradedCarMax(KMX)to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $42, down from $53.

Top 5 Initiations: Raymond James initiated coverage ofBlack Rock Coffee(BRCB)with an Outperform rating and $26 price target. Near-term comps and EBITDA results should remain strong driven by tangible, company specific initiatives, and new unit performance should continue to strengthen under its new real estate model, supporting confidence in the company's open-ended long-term unit growth opportunity, the firm tells investors in a research note. William Blair also started coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating. Deutsche Bank initiated coverage ofVia Transportation(VIA)with a Buy rating and $55 price target.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs initiated Via with Neutral-equivalent ratings. UBS resumed coverage ofDigitalOcean(DOCN)with a Neutral rating with a price target of $40, up from $32. The firm's checks suggest a steady core demand backdrop, and while they did lean positive on DigitalOcean's newer AI products, it seems too early for these to be needle movers. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage ofLegence(LGN)with a Buy rating and $37 price target, implying 20% upside. The firm says Legence is a leading contractor and engineering company specializing in mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems. BMO Capital, Rothschild & Co Redburn, Stifel, BTIG, Wolfe Research, BofA, Cantor Fitzgerald, Guggenheim, and Bernstein started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. Meanwhile, Jefferies and Barclays initiated Legence with Neutral-equivalent ratings. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage ofGemini(GEMI)with an Overweight rating and $37 price target. After resolving the fallout from its failed ""Earn"" program and restoring customer assets, Gemini is positioned for renewed growth driven by higher marketing spend, rising trading volumes, and expanding assets on its platform, creating strong revenue potential and an appealing risk/reward profile with shares still below their IPO price, the firm tells investors in a research note. Rosenblatt, Needham, Mizuho, Evercore ISI, and Truist also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings, while Morgan Stanley, Keefe Bruyette, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Barclays initiated Gemini with Neutral-equivalent ratings."
NFLX,Elon Musk or This Head & Shoulders Pattern: Which is More Dangerous for Netflix Stock Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-head-shoulders-pattern-125001374.html,2025-10-08,"Netflix (NFLX) shares have fallen more than 10% from recent highs, wiping out roughly $15 billion in market value, after Elon Musk urged users on X to cancel their subscriptions over what he called “woke content.” Musk’s post — “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids” — quickly went viral, sparking a wave of subscription cancellations and social debate.

The stock now trades near $1,160, down from a recent high over $1,300, with technical warning signs beginning to appear. In last Friday’sMarket on Closelivestream, co-hosts John Rowland, CMT, and “Twitter Tom” shared their view: While Tom noted that, “I don’t like buying names that are in the headlines for the wrong reasons,” John observed that NFLX “looks a little head-and-shoulders-ish to me.” John explained that if Netflix breaks below the $1,140–$1,150 range, it could retest support at a gap near $1,000 — about a 10% move lower from current levels. While Netflix remains the world’s leading streaming service — with what Rowland jokingly called “35 gazillion subscriptions” — he also pointed to a larger concern: consumer spending in a slowing economy: “If we get into a recessionary period and consumers start feeling tight purse strings, this might be one of the first discretionary items to go.” That concern aligns with broader macro signals investors are watching, from rising credit card delinquencies to weakening consumer sentiment data. Netflix’s sell-off is as much about sentiment as it is about fundamentals. With Elon Musk’s “Cancel Netflix” campaign amplifying social pressure — and technical patterns showing potential weakness — investors should watch closely how the $1,140–$1,000 support zone holds up.

NFLX,Should You Buy Netflix Stock Before October 21?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-netflix-stock-october-21-013000719.html,2025-10-08,"In each of the past two quarters, Netflix’s revenue and earnings per share beat Wall Street estimates. Over a short time horizon, market sentiment is the key factor that drives stock prices. Investors looking to buy the stock should focus on fundamentals, as well as the current valuation. 10 stocks we like better than Netflix › The calendar quarter just ended. And with the start of October here, companies are getting ready to provide investors with a fresh set of financials, giving the market valuable insights into their operations.Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX)is usually early to report its numbers, with itsearnings callscheduled later in the month of October. Netflix continues to have a lot of momentum on its side. And it has been a wildly successful investment in the past. Should you buy thistop streaming stockbefore its Q3 earnings update is revealed on Oct. 21? Netflix shares have crushed the market in the past. Over the last decade, shares have soared nearly 1,000% (as of Oct. 2). The gains have continued recently, as the stock is up 30% in 2025 (at the time of this writing). It's usual that for shares to perform so well, the underlying business reports financial results that come up well ahead of expectations. This is precisely what Netflix has done. When the company reported Q1 and Q2 results, it beat Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. And for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, thesell-side analystcommunity expects Netflix to report revenue of $11.5 billion and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $6.95. These projections are roughly in line with what Netflix's leadership team is forecasting. Executives think sales and diluted EPS will grow 17.3% and 27.2%, respectively, in the third quarter. If the company outperforms, there is a very strong likelihood that the stock will pop. Even better, a favorable outlook for Q4 to wrap up the year would certainly drive even more bullish fever. Should this happen, it would be a smart move to buy shares today. Regardless of the view you have on Netflix's third quarter financials, no one has any idea how the market will react. In the short term, sentiment is the biggest factor moving share prices. And there's no way to accurately predict what the market's mood will be at any given point in time. While it can certainly be exciting to make an investment decision based on an upcoming event, with the goal of generating a quick profit, investors should really be thinking about this situation with along-term time horizon. In other words, only look to buy Netflix shares with a perspective that's fixed on the next five or 10 years. This will force you to consider the factors that are most important, which are the fundamentals of the business. Based onNetflix's ongoing success, investors can confidently say that the company will likely have more subscribers, as well as higher revenue and earnings, in the future. That's a very encouraging perspective to have. And it's not a wild assumption, especially with proven pricing power, the impressive adoption of the ad-supported tier, strong free cash flow generation, and a fruitful entry into live events. However, the market has lofty expectations, as shown by the valuation. Shares currently trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49.5, which is certainly expensive any way you look at it. Of course, a clear argument can be made that Netflix is deserving of such a high P/E multiple. It has a large and engaged global audience, massive scale to invest in fresh content, a powerful brand name, and robust financial performance. It's hard to be pessimistic, even though a reasonable perspective is that returns going forward might disappoint. In my view, the stock is too rich to put new capital to work. However, if investors have a desire to own the best companies in the world, then I can understand why buying shares today is the move. Just make sure you're making a decision that's based on looking well beyond the Oct. 21 financial update.

NFLX,"Does This Valuation Of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Imply Investors Are Overpaying?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-valuation-netflix-inc-nasdaq-140008836.html,2025-10-08,"Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Netflix fair value estimate is US$925 Netflix is estimated to be 25% overvalued based on current share price of US$1,153 Analyst price target for NFLX is US$1,355,which is 47% above our fair value estimate How far off is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in theSimply Wall St analysis model. This technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality. We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars: 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 2035 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$12.0b US$14.4b US$18.0b US$21.4b US$24.0b US$26.3b US$28.2b US$30.0b US$31.5b US$33.0b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x19 Analyst x17 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Est @ 12.06% Est @ 9.37% Est @ 7.48% Est @ 6.16% Est @ 5.24% Est @ 4.59% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$11.0k US$12.1k US$14.0k US$15.2k US$15.7k US$15.8k US$15.6k US$15.2k US$14.7k US$14.1k (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)= US$143b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 3.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2035× (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$33b× (1 + 3.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 3.1%) = US$585b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$585b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$250b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$393b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$1.2k, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Netflix as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.258. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. See our latest analysis for Netflix Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is not viewed as a risk. Weakness Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market. Threat Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year. Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

NFLX,Beyond Streaming: Netflix's Quiet Moves Into Gaming and Live Experiences,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beyond-streaming-netflixs-quiet-moves-171400082.html,2025-10-08,"Netflix is extending beyond streaming into gaming, broadcasting live sports, and real-world venues. Execution risks are significant. The initiatives won’t drive revenue today, but provide valuable long-term optionality. 10 stocks we like better than Netflix › Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX)has built its empire on streaming video content, but the company isn't content to stop there. While investors focus on its subscriber growth and ad revenue, Netflix is quietly laying the groundwork for new frontiers: gaming, immersive real-world venues, and live sports and other events. These initiatives may not move the needle today, but they reveal Netflix's ambitions to be more than just a content platform. The big question for investors: Are these side bets a distraction from Netflix's core, or could they evolve into meaningful growth engines? Netflix's interactive experiments, such asBandersnatch, which allowed viewers to pick the direction of the story, are fading away. Instead, the company is building an actual gaming business across four categories: party games, narrative titles, children's games, and mainstream hits. Recent steps show Netflix is serious. It licensed blockbuster titles likeGrand TheftAuto Vfor mobile, is developing original projects such asThronglets-- in which ""you manage an ever-growing population of the little yellow guys"" -- and is testing cloud-based gaming on smart TVs, where most Netflix viewing already happens. Phones serve as controllers, lowering friction for users. But execution remains uneven. Engagement is still limited, with only a small fraction of subscribers regularly playing games. A recent studio closure and leadership changes underscore the challenges of scaling. For investors, the upside is clear. Gaming could strengthen engagement and open new ways tomake money from online users. The risk is equally obvious. Games are expensive, and Netflix hasn't yet proven it can compete in a crowded industry. Later this year, Netflix plans to open its first Netflix House locations in Philadelphia and Dallas. These venues will feature themed dining, merchandise, virtual reality activities, and interactive experiences tied to hit franchises likeStranger ThingsandSquid Game. This approach borrows fromDisney's playbook, turningintellectual propertyinto real-world touchpoints. If successful, Netflix House could deepen fan engagement and add incremental revenue beyond subscriptions. While still niche, it demonstrates Netflix's broader goal: stretching its content into multiple formats to strengthen loyalty and brand stickiness. Netflix once dismissed live programming, but that stance has shifted. The company recently signed a three-year deal with the NFL to stream Christmas Day games through 2027. It also committed $5 billion over 10 years for exclusive streaming rights to WWE'sMonday Night Raw. And Netflix locked in exclusive rights to the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women's World Cups in the U.S. and Canada. On the entertainment side, Netflix is also leaning into variety. This year, it launchedEverybody's Live with John Mulaney, a weekly live talk show airing every Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET. Add in one-off comedy specials and fan events, and the message is clear: Netflix is no longer a pure on-demand service. Live programming offers two advantages: it attracts advertisers, and it helps reduce churn by giving subscribers reasons to tune in at specific times. The challenge, however, lies in execution. Rights are expensive, and Netflix must prove it can translate these moves into sustainable profits in a space long dominated by traditional broadcasters. Gaming, immersive venues, and live sports don't move the financial needle yet. Netflix still generates the bulk of its revenue from streaming subscriptions and is only beginning to monetize its ad-supported tier, where users pay less and see ads. But these initiatives serve two crucial purposes: Reduce reliance on shows and films. Add future revenue streams. For investors, the key is patience. Netflix is planting seeds, not harvesting profits. Some projects may fail, but even one breakout success could expand its long-term growth runway. Netflix's quiet moves beyond streaming show a company unwilling to stand still. Gaming, live events, and real-world venues all carry execution risks, but they also highlight Netflix's ambition to evolve into a broader entertainment platform. These bets don't change the investment thesis today, but they give Netflix long-term optionality. It's a stock that growth investors should track closely.

NFLX,Netflix stock logs biggest weekly drop since April as Elon Musk calls for users to cancel subscriptions,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-logs-biggest-weekly-drop-since-april-as-elon-musk-calls-for-users-to-cancel-subscriptions-200715651.html,2025-10-08,"Netflix (NFLX) shares fell Friday, cementing their biggest weekly decline since April 4. The stock dropped nearly 5% over the 5-day trading period ending Friday as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk continued to urge consumers to boycott the streaming giant. The stock has lagged the broader market,which has climbed about 2% to new record highs over the past week, and has also trailed Big Tech peers like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META). This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. The drop comes as Musk amps up calls for a boycott, urging his 227 million followers on X to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and accusing the streamer of pushing alleged transgender messaging in kids' shows. Over the past several days, Musk has posted or reposted a series of messages criticizing Netflix’s programming: “Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids,” Musk wrote on Tuesday. Netflix did not respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Musk's campaign comes as the streamer prepares to report third quarter earnings later this month. Since the company no longer discloses subscriber numbers on a quarterly basis, the short-term impact of any boycott may be difficult to quantify. In its most recent earnings report,Netflix topped Wall Street expectationsand raised its full-year revenue outlook, although the results failed to clear what many analysts described as a high bar for performance. The company expects third quarter revenue of $11.53 billion and EPS of $6.87, both above initial consensus estimates. For the full year, Netflix now sees revenue between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion, reflecting solid growth in its ad-supported tier, foreign exchange tailwinds, and steady user engagement. Executives have said ad sales are on pace to roughly double to $3 billion next year, while new seasons of flagship shows like ""Wednesday,"" ""Stranger Things,"" and ""Squid Game,"" alongside expanding live sports offerings, should help sustain momentum. This isn’t the first time Netflix has found itself at the center of a social media firestorm. In 2020, the streamerfaced bipartisan backlashfollowing the release of the French coming-of-age film ""Cuties,"" which critics accused of over-sexualizing young girls. At the time, subscription analytics firm Antenna reported cancellations surged fivefold, while YipitData found churn hit a multiyear high. The hashtag #CancelNetflix also trended for days. Still, the company weathered that controversy with little long-term damage to its subscriber base. And despite recent volatility, analysts remain broadly optimistic. On Thursday, in the midst of the Musk turmoil, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein reiterated his Outperform rating and $1,425 price target on the stock, citing strong third quarter engagement data with hours viewed up 20% year over year, as well as continued momentum in live sports programming and original content.

NFLX,"Netflix, Occidental Petroleum, Bumble: Trending Tickers",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/netflix-occidental-petroleum-bumble-trending-195024273.html,2025-10-08,"Market Domination hostJosh Liptonand Yahoo Finance senior reporterAllie Canaltrack several of the day's top trending stock tickers, including Netflix (NFLX)facing share pressures this weekafter Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk called for a boycott over the platform's children's content; HSBC securities and Mizuho analysts both upgrading Occidental Petroleum (OXY) amid Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A,BRK-B)deal to acquire OxyChem for $9.7 billion; and shares of dating app Bumble (BMBL) receiving a downgrade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. Now time for today's trending tickers. Yahoo Finance's Alec Canal still here with me. We're gonna take a look at Netflix, Occidental Petroleum, and we'll talk a little bumble. We're gonna start with Netflix. Stock headed for a downbeat week following Elon Musk calls for a boycott of the platform after joining in on criticism of its animated show Dead End Paranormal Park. So this one, Ali, so Musk is posting about canceling his Netflix subscription. You had Robby Starbuck, well known conservative activist, he's out there.On this, I mean, not what you need if you're Netflix, not what you need if you're any company, really, right? And this has been going on for a few days now, something that we've been talking about. Netflix is on track to close the 5 day period down 5%. At one point during the lows of the session today, we were on track to have the steepest weekly loss since April. We have since come back from some of those losses here, but like you were just saying, I mean, Elon Musk telling his 227.million followers on X to cancel their subscriptions. He's been continuously posting about it. It's making noise. Netflix hasn't commented on the backlash, and analysts overall have been bullish. We just saw Oppenheimer reiterate they're outperform rating. They continue to see further tailwinds for this company as they double down on ads, live sports content. They have a lot of that marquee programming still to come towards the end of the year, and the stock has just been such aOutperformer this year, I mean, despite the volatility, we still have shares that are rising 30% since the start of the year. We are trading well above $1100 a share. We'll be getting earnings from this company later this month, so we'll see that update, but as a reminder here, Netflix does not report quarterly subscriber figures any longer, so it will be a bit more tough, I guess, to size any impact from this. I'm not minimizing.it, I mean, when, when Elon Musk is going after you, but I'm not, I'm still trying to understand maybe get my head around what you're supposed to do as an investor about it, right? Yeah, like you mentioned Oppenheimer's, you know, that's Jason Helstein over there, and Jason's been doing this a long time and you know, to his point, he reiterated the A form. He emphasized his clients what he called strong Q3 engagement data, but I guess to your point we'll wait and see. Yeah, and Netflix has been in controversial situations before back in 2020 I reported on their cuties.Controversy. So this was a French film. It faced, you know, criticism over over sexualizing children and the stock took a little bit of a hint. There was that cancel Netflix trending on social media, but they weathered that storm and just continued to climb higher from there. So it feels like this is just a short term blip for them. All right, we'll see. Turning now to Occident Petroleum, let's look at that name. That's not getting an upgrade over at HSBC Securities and Mizuo. So this one, Ali, Mizuo actually upgraded the.Company's going to outperform. This is coming after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy the company's petrochemical business for around $9.7 billion. They say, uh, would you expect to close in the fourth quarter? Uh, folks looked at this and actually thought, well, maybe the Oracle back on the hunt, right? The analysts saying Occidental, this unfetters the balance sheet targets to 60. Yeah, that comment unfettering the balance sheet, giving Oxy more flexibility to focus on its core oil and gas businesses and the price.It was also raised to $60 from the prior 58 and HS HSBC on board as well. So we're seeing a lot of this optimism now. It is interesting from the Berkshire side of things, this Occidental chemical unit purchased $9.7 billion you mentioned some were talking about, oh, Warren Buffett, maybe he wants to put that record cash pile to work. Is he back on the hunt? But we were talking about this with our head of news, Miles Udlin, and he was saying, you know, Buffett's out.Very shortly this might be a new era for Greg Abel who's going to take over at the helm of that company and what is Berkshire without Buffett and what does the M&A activity look like? what's going to be the outlook for Berkshire now with Greg Abel in that top position and that's an overarching question, I think, for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders moving forward and this Oxy purchase maybe is the start of that regime. Yes, miles. By the way, kind of my go to guy. He knows alot about Berkshire. He's been following Bubba for a while, following Berkshire for a while. He goes, he's been to those meetings, so I trust, I trust his commentary total bro. Lassie Bumble gets hit now this with a downgrade over Goldman. Lone gets rating on that stock from Bay they go to neutral, so moving to the sidelines alley. Um, this is Eric Sheridan, well known guy. Uh, current estimates could reflect that visibility into a turnaround of the core bumble app remains low.Likely not until mid 2026. Targets set to 7. Stock is down nearly 30% thisyear. Yeah, just a brutal year to date run for this stock. You're seeing the reaction today down 3%. The goal in cutting that rating to neutral from buy, warning that the turnaround for the core app could take time. Don't see growth really picking up until mid 2026. $7 price target bumble's already down as.You said significantly year to date, it just feels like there's not a lot of momentum and I know Josh, you're not on these apps. Unfortunately I have dabbled and it's just not good. It's not good out there for all these apps. They make you pay for anything worthwhile. I don't feel like doing that. The quality is just not there for me. So as as a user, I'm a bit disappointed, so I can understand how investors could be and investors disappointed good appreciate it."
NFLX,Netflix stock defended at Oppenheimer amid recent underperformance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-defended-oppenheimer-amid-165611650.html,2025-10-08,"Investing.com -- Oppenheimer analysts have reaffirmed their positive stance on Netflix, maintaining an Outperform rating and a $1,425 price target despite the stock’s recent weakness. “Given strong 3Q engagement data and stock underperformance, we are reiterating our $1,425 target and Outperform rating ahead of earnings,” Oppenheimer wrote. The bank highlighted Netflix’s momentum in user activity as a key factor underpinning its call. “3Q engagement has been strong, with hours viewed +20% y/y and should only improve long-term as NFLX pushes more into live events, expanding its competitive advantage,” the analysts said. The firm believes that potential sports rights deals could further strengthen that position. Media reports suggest Netflix is close to signing an exclusive deal for the New York Yankees’ Opening Day game. “We could see an NFL announcement with NFL reportedly renegotiating its media rights deals ahead of schedule,” Oppenheimer added. The analysts also downplayed competitive risks from broader media consolidation. “We believe rumored WBD/PSKY deal is immaterial to NFLX based on our NFLX viewership data analysis,” they said. Another upcoming catalyst is expected to be the company’s 2026 guidance. “NFLX should also provide 2026 financial guidance for the first time, which we see as another catalyst,” the note said. Oppenheimer’s price target is based on a 20-times multiple of its 2030 earnings per share forecast.

In a post on X, Musk told followers to Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids, joining conservative criticism of the animated show Dead End Paranormal Park, which featured a transgender character before being canceled in 2023. He also responded to claims about the show's creator that fueled backlash online. Hamish Steele, the show's creator, responded on Bluesky, calling it a very odd day and sharing support from TV writers who described the show as positive and inclusive. Netflix has not commented. The headlines weighed on Netflix stock, which is down 4% this week. But analysts say Musk's call for a boycott is unlikely to dent results. The company has more than 300 million subscribers worldwide and a nearly $490 billion market value. Analysts at Wedbush and others noted that any cancellations could be offset by rising ad revenue, and some viewers may even sign up in response to the backlash. Traders compared the moment to past boycotts against consumer brands but expect this one to fade quickly. Netflix's next earnings report later this month will give investors a clearer view of whether the controversy had any real impact."
