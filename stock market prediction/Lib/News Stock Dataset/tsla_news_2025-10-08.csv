TSLA,Auto delinquencies are surging across income levels: VantageScore,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/auto-delinquencies-surging-across-income-214500481.html,2025-10-08,"Auto loan delinquencies have soared by more than 50% over the last 15 years, according to a new VantageScore report, making them one of the riskiest products for consumer credit scores. VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo sits down withJosh Liptonto talk more about the data and affordability issues in auto loans. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreAsking for a Trend. Well, a new report from Vantage score shows a troubling trend in the auto loan market. Delinquencies are climbing more than 50% since 2010, and it's not just from risky borrowers. For more, we're bringing in Ricardo Bandabo, chief economist at Vantage score. Ricardo, it is good to see you. Let's start off with auto loans because you were breaking down that data and it was an interesting report. What you say now, correct me if I have this wrong, but you call it the riskiest credit product now? What what is going on there? What are the trends? Walk us through it. So, what we saw was that in Q1 of this year, actually auto loans became the riskiest consumer credit product. Um and that has been something that has been evolving over some time. Um so what we did is we actually because this is a question we get asked by lenders and economists all the time. What's going on with these auto loans and the delinquencies? So, we went back and looked at the data going all the way back to the end of the last recession. And what we see is that actually, going back to the first quarter of 2010, at that point, auto loans were actually the least risky of all consumer loan products. And then and now, this year, we now hit the point where it's the most risky one. And during that time period, what we saw was that every other loan category actually has seen their delinquency rates go down from the first quarter of 2010. whilst at the same time, auto loans have gone up over 50%. Is that, Now, what are the reasons for that? Is that affordability? Is that people are are they biting off more than they can chew? What are the variables? Yeah, so we did a big study. We we pulled in our data, we pulled in data from the government data and big did a big regression analysis. And what we found was that there are really two themes that are driving this. First one is very much as you insinuated, is the affordability, right? So, um as we look at for instance average loan sizes, we've actually seen that in this period of 15 years, the average auto loan has gone up faster than any other product, including mortgage, right? It's gone up 57%. So, on top of that, in terms of affordability, more recently, we've seen interest rates go up. So that's kind of a double whammy on the on your monthly outlay, right for your auto loan. Not only has the principle gone up, but the interest payment has significantly gone up as well. And given that auto loans are typically one of the second or third biggest outlay in an average household on a monthly basis, that's a pretty big hit for many consumers. Who when we talk what are the consumers that are, Ricardo, most vulnerable when we talk about auto delinquencies? So, like always, you tend to see that obviously subprime consumers have higher delinquency rates than others. Um but what the interesting trend that we're seeing here is that a couple years ago, as these auto loans started to rise more quickly, a lot of auto lenders adjusted their lending criteria. But that didn't stop the delinquencies increasing. What we saw was that, yes, we saw that um subprime auto loans actually reduced in risk. We saw less delinquencies from subprime based on their changes. But at the same time, we saw the amount of delinquencies coming from near prime and prime consumers going up quite a bit. So, it's not necessarily then the the answer that most people expect that it's subprime. It seems to be that their challenges with those people that are actually from higher income households and have had traditionally better credit health."
TSLA,Tesla reveals cheaper Model Y and Model 3 Standard versions,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-reveals-cheaper-model-y-and-model-3-standard-versions-184000339.html,2025-10-08,"Tesla (TSLA) finally revealed a stripped-down version of its Model Y, dubbed the Standard, and in a surprise move announced the Model 3 Standard as well. The two cars are now available for order on Tesla's US website. The Model Y Standard is rear-wheel drive, will start at $39,990, and has an estimated range of 321 miles with standard 18-inch wheels. The Model 3 Standard comes in even cheaper, at $36,990, and has the same range. While the Model Y Standard is available for November/December delivery, the Model 3 Standard arrives a little later, with a December/January delivery range. Appearance-wise, the Standard trim omits the front and rear light bars on the Model Y and comes in only three colors: Stealth Grey, white, and Diamond Black. The only interior color available is black. Tesla stockgained more than 5%on Monday after the EV maker posted gifs on Sunday of aspinning company logowith the date ""10/7"" and what appeared to becar headlights shining through smoke. Shares pulled back nearly 4% on Tuesday following the update to Tesla's website. Inside, both Standard trims feature the same 15.4-inch infotainment screen as the more expensive models. However, there's no second-row screen, the ambient lighting has been removed, and cheaper cloth seating inserts surround vegan leather, per Tesla's website. Interestingly, Tesla removed the AM/FM radio tuners from the Standard trim, and the Standard models can only perform ""traffic aware cruise control,"" Tesla's version of adaptive cruise control, and are unable to perform ""autosteer"" functions like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD). It is also likely that Tesla has wrung out costs from its batteries and electric motors to make the vehicles cheaper. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. The Model Y and Model 3 Standard versions come after the federal EV tax credit expired in the US on Sept. 30. CEO Elon Musk said in the company's second quarter earnings call that the cheaper Model Y would come out after the tax credit expires. Read more:How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance Tesla said following Q2 earnings that the first builds of a more affordable model occurred in June, with volume production planned for the second half of 2025. Tesla's release of these cheaper vehicles is expected to help grow volume for the automaker, which has seen sales dip in recent quarters, although Q3 sales jumped as buyers bought EVs ahead of the tax credit expiration. Last quarter, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said he expected a pull forward of sales in Q3 because of the tax credit expiration, and the numbers back up that claim. Tesla reportedQ3 deliveriescame in at 497,099, easily topping Bloomberg consensus estimates of around 439,800 and the 462,890 units delivered a year ago. Tesla said Q3's total was a new quarterly record for the company. Tesla is set to report full Q3 results on Oct. 22 after the closing bell, with the company's annual shareholder meeting to follow on Nov. 6.

As the government shutdown stretches into its seventh day, President Trump is floating the idea ofentering negotiations with Democratic leadersover health care policy. Tesla (TSLA) is expected to unveil a cheaper version of its Model Y electric vehicle at an event today afterteasing the product launch on social mediaon Monday. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMorning Brief. Let's get to the three things you need to know today. First up, US stock futures pulling back this morning. That's after the S&P 500 closed at a record high. Tech stocks fueling the rally after AMD signed a deal worth tens of billions of dollars with Open AI. We are seeing now a recovery in futures this morning, still little changed. Meanwhile, gold pulling back from a record high. The precious metal has surged Actually, no, it is not pulling back. It's higher. The precious metal has surged 50% this year. It's on a record-breaking run amid the trade war, Federal Reserve rate cuts and the government shutdown. And as that shutdown enters its seventh day, the president is signaling some willingness to negotiate on healthcare, but there's a catch. The president first wants Democrats to vote on a temporary spending bill that would fund the government through November. Since the government shutdown began, Democrats and Republicans have been at an impass over extending Obamacare subsidies. The latest round of votes in the Senate failed to advance both the Republican-led stop gap funding measure and a Democratic alternative. And Tesla gearing up for its product event. Shares initially jumping on the cryptic social media post that the company shared, teasing an October 7th event. But new reports from Bloomberg say the company plans to unveil a cheaper version of the Model Y. That cheaper vehicle will reportedly lack certain features and use less premium materials to offset the loss of the federal tax credit that the US stopped offering as of this month. That stock up about 12%."
TSLA,"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 close at record highs to cap Wall Street's latest winning week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-close-at-record-highs-to-cap-wall-streets-latest-winning-week-200046718.html,2025-10-08,"US stocks capped a winning week on Friday as Wall Street fixated on the promise of artificial intelligence, even as a government shutdowndelayed the release of the monthly jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) touched 47,000 before paring gains but still closed up 0.5% at a fresh all-time high. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose just above the flatline and eked out a new record too. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) erased earlier gains to fall 0.3% as Tesla (TSLA) stock sank. All three major averages closed out the week with gains of more than 1%. Wall Street has largely shrugged off the initial stages of the US government shutdown. Its impact was felt in investor circles Friday, as itdelayed the release of the data, leaving Wall Street and the Federal Reserve in the dark. In its absence, Wall Street has turned to abevy of private datathat hasconfirmed the labor market's sharp slowdownthis week. But even amid the unanswered questions on the health of the US economy,stocks keep risingto new records, largely on the back of continued AI fervor.OpenAI's valuation climbed to $500 billion, making the company the most valuable startup in the world. On Friday, new AI deals boosted optimism. Hitachi LTD (6501.T) teamed up with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) on energy projects, while Fujitsu (6501.T) expanded work with Nvidia (NVDA). Other sectors also continued standout performances — most notably pharma stocks, which by one measure were headedtoward their best week in over a decade. Meanwhile, there was no immediate end in sight to the shutdown. Democrats continue to push for the continuation of healthcare subsidies as a condition of funding the government, while Republicans refuse to negotiate on the issue until the government is back up and running. At the same time, President Trump has continued to ramp up his threats tofire federal workersand defundprojects in Democratic-leaning states. Citi strategist have warned that US technology stocks face growing risks as investors seek to cash in on this year’s record-breaking rally. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. Bloomberg News reports: The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) is most vulnerable to the threat, after soaring 46% from its April lows thanks to resurgent enthusiasm around advances in artificial intelligence. The tech-heavy benchmark set its latest record on Monday after Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s (AMD) blockbuster deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). “Profit-taking risks have rapidly risen across markets, and are particularly elevated for Nasdaq, potentially hampering further upside,” the Citi team led by Chris Montagu wrote in a note. Optimism over AI keeps propelling the stock market to new highs, eclipsing concerns such as the US government shutdown or the lingering threat to the economy from trade tariffs. The Nasdaq 100 has already closed at a record 30 times this year through Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Last year, the benchmark set 45 closing peaks. For the moment, investors continue to add to wagers on stock market gains. Read more here. Investors shrugged off a government shutdown as the Dow and S&P 500 posted fresh records on Friday.

Yahoo Finance's Dan Howlyreports: Add Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos to the growing list of people calling Wall Street's AI craze a bubble. During aconversation at Italian Tech Week, Bezos said the artificial intelligence hype cycle is pushing investors to spend billions on both good and bad ideas. Despite that, Bezos said he believes AI is a very real product that will impact companies across industries and society more broadly.

Stocks rallied as the lack of a jobs report because of the government shutdown increased bets that the data released so far may be enough for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again this month. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also moved up 0.5% to hit new records, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.2%. The US services sector gauge fromthe Institute for Supply Managementfell 2 percentage points to 50% in September from the previous month. The reading was below the 51.7% economists' forecast, per Bloomberg consensus data. Business activity within the sector also fell to 49.9%, down from 55% in August. ""This is the first time the index has entered contraction territory since May 2020,"" the release said, noting 50% marks the breakeven point between expansion and contraction. The prices paid for materials and services increased to 69.4% from August's 69.2%. It's now approaching October 2022's all-time high of 70.7%. ""This is telling you that maybe the inflationary pressures that are the biggest worry, and [have] been the biggest worry in many FOMC speeches, are beginning to show more signs of life,"" Torsten Sløk, Apollo Global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance.(Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) ""The higher rise in service sector inflation we just got ... is suggesting that maybe inflation is going to be more sticky and more elevated,"" Sløk said. The next Consumer Price Index (CPI) report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to come out on Oct. 15 at 8:30 a.m. ET, but may be delayed if the government shutdown continues. Services make up 60% of the CPI index, whereas goods account for 40%. The ISM's employment index also remained in contraction but increased to 47.2% in September from August's reading of 46.5%. Respondents said artificial intelligence is positively impacting resource productivity. Industrials (XLI) and Utilities (XLU) hit all-time highs on Friday as the AI trade continued to expand beyond tech. The boom in artificial intelligence is not only helping Nvidia (NVDA) and other tech players in the space. The electrical upgrade and power needs necessary for the boom have also been flying high. Year to date, utilities and industrial stocks have outperformed the broader market, right behind tech and communications services. Chevron (CVX) stock was largely unchanged Friday after a fire broke out at the company's El Segundo refinery in Los Angeles County. There were no injuries or evacuations of nearby residents, the company said as firefightersresponded to the blaze. The fire comes amid a series of refinery closures in California that have tightened supply and ahead of a major decision by the Organization of Oil Producing Countries and its allies (OPEC+) this weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures (CL=F) rose 0.6% to $60 a barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F) rose 0.5% to $64 a barrel as traders braced for OPEC+ topush through more supply hikes.Oil prices have fallen roughly 7% this week and are on track for the largest weekly loss since June. Stocks opened higher on Friday after the September jobs report was delayed due to the government shutdown but AI optimism continued to run high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) all rose by around 0.1%. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) rose slightly to 4.09%, and the 30-year bond (^TYX) held pat at 4.6%. Gold (GC=F) continued to climb to record highs at $3,906.10 an ounce. Bitcoin also rose 1% to $120,524 per token. It's been a strong week for quantum stocks. Shares of Rigetti Computing (RGTI) powered over 4% higher in premarket trading on Friday, building on an 18% spike on Thursday. Meanwhile, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) also added 4% premarket to Thursday's 13% gain. And Quantum Computing (QUBT) stock rose 12% over the past two days. All three stocks were among the toptrending tickerson Yahoo Finance. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. Driving the stocks higher was Rigetti's announcement that it sold two 9-qubit Novera quantum computing systems for $5.7 million on Tuesday. One system was bought by an Asian technology manufacturing company, Rigetti said, while the other was purchased by a California-based applied physics and artificial intelligence startup. D-Wave also announced this week that it was testing its technology with the North Wales Police Department ""to optimize placement of police vehicles for emergency response."" Wall Street analysts see enormous potential in quantum stocks, but the underlying technology is still considered in the developmental phase, which is why they're seen as riskier plays. While quantum computing can solve complex tasks, making them useful in certain fields, the systems areprone to errors. And as neither company is profitable, valuations remain another concern. Despite a rocky start to the year, Rigetti and D-Wave, the two leaders in the space, have climbed 132% and 247%, respectively, year to date. Typically, around this time, we would turn to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly employment report to assess how many jobs the US added in September. Economists polled by FactSet expected the US to have added around50,000 jobsduring the month and for the unemployment rate to have held steady at 4.3%. But with the government closed for the third day, that hotly anticipated datais delayed, leaving investors and economists to piece together a picture of a softening labor market with data fromjob openings,private payrolls, and other indicators. As my colleaguesEmma OckermanandKerry Hannonnote, the longer the shutdown stretches on, the bigger a deal it will be for those awaiting the data: September’s initial jobs data has already been collected and essentially just needs someone in the government to hit publish, Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet told Yahoo Finance. While there’s “never a good time for the government to shut down,” the current moment is especially inopportune, he said. The Federal Reserve, which cutrates in September,is closely monitoring the health of the labor market andmeets again in late October. Read more here. Please note: Some US government economic data will not be released today due to the federal shutdown. Economic data:Nonfarm payrolls (September); Unemployment rate (September); Average hourly earnings (September); S&P Global US services PMI (September final reading); ISM services index (September) Earnings calendar:No notable earnings. Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Tesla's tax credits are ending, but the AI benefit is only beginning Stock bulls can't get enough of S&P as rally enters 'manic' zone Gold stocks trounce AI-driven chip rally with 135% gain in 2025 BlackRock nears $40B data center deal in bet on AI Other ways to view the US labor market beyond the jobs report Trump firing threats dismissed as US shutdown drags on Large fire erupts at Los Angeles-area Chevron refinery Goldman's Solomon expects US economy to accelerate The bulls are out in force today on Amazon (AMZN) ahead of its third quarter earnings release in a few weeks. DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria reiterated a buy rating on Amazon, citing an increasingly upbeat outlook for Amazon AWS cloud sales. Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan also has a buy rating on Amazon today, as he is also bullish on cloud sales. Sheridan says Amazon is a preferred name in his large-cap tech coverage. He sees Amazon AWS sales growing a steady 20% plus for the balance of this year and into 2026. And you thought Amazon just made bank from Prime memberships. Nope!

Tesla (TSLA) shares are up 1% in premarket trading on Friday. But the stock fell 5% on Thursday despite better-than-expectedglobal third quarter deliveries, which were likely lifted by customers rushing to cash in on EV tax credits before they expire. As Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban writes in today's Morning Brief,the rush to cash in on tax breaksbefore their end comes at a moment of uncertainty for Tesla. A challenging first half of the year, tied in part to the public backlash against CEO Elon Musk, has weighed on the company, just as it works to redefine itself as an AI and robotics giant. That helps explain why the stock fell even after beating Wall Street delivery estimates,but remains near all-time highs. If the criticism against Tesla — the stock — is that it is divorced from the actual business of selling cars, then the response from its leadership and faithful backers is that Tesla isn't a car company, and shouldn't trade like one. Investors are eyeing production plans for the Cybercab, Tesla's dedicated autonomous vehicle at the heart of its robotaxi service. The company plans to start churning them out as soon as next year. And the bulls hope it's a paradigm shift. ""The AI valuation will start to get unlocked in the Tesla story, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for TSLA over the next six to nine months has now begun,"" Wedbush analyst and vocal Tesla bull Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.

Bloomberg News reports: David Solomon expects the US economy to accelerate into 2026 as tailwinds from continued stimulus and tech spending outweigh a softer labor market and geopolitical turmoil. Government spending and “all of the AI infrastructure build” means — on balance — the economy was “still in pretty good shape,” the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) CEO said, despite the impact of tariffs and a slower US job market. Solomon previously warned on Sept. 10 that the US economy was softening, citing President Donald Trump’s trade policies as a factor. The banking boss also expects dealmaking to pick up even further in the US, he said in an interview at Italian Tech Week in Turin. The “changed regulatory environment” means CEOs are increasingly ambitious when it comes to M&A. Solomon said he expects a “drawdown” from equity markets in the next 12 to 24 months. But that shouldn’t be a surprise given the long runup in stocks, seen particularly in the largest AI-driven technology plays. “I’m not going to bed every night worrying about what’s happening next,” he said.

Hitachi (6501.T) shares rose as much as 9%, the most since April 10, after the company announced a tie-up with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), the latest in a growing list of pacts between Japanese tech firms and US artificial intelligence giants. Bloomberg News reports: The strategic partnership will involve collaboration on Hitachi’s energy and power grid operations, cooling equipment, storage and its digital solutions hub Lumada, a Hitachi representative told Bloomberg. Hitachi and OpenAI signed a memorandum of understanding on Oct. 2, the Japanese company said in a post on social media site X. Growing collaboration with US firms is adding fuel to Japan’s tech stock rally, which has already helped power the nations’ equity benchmarks to all-time highs.

US technology giant Nvidia (NVDA) has teamed up with Japanese telecommunications and computer maker, Fujitsu (6702.T) and agreed to work on AI products to help deliver smart robots and other innovations using Nvidia's chips. The news sent Fujitsu shares up by 3% on Friday. AP reports: “The AI industrial revolution has already begun. Building the infrastructure to power it is essential in Japan and around the world,” Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said, hugging his Fujitsu counterpart Takahito Tokita on stage. “Japan can lead the world in AI and robotics,” Huang told reporters at a Tokyo hotel. The companies will work together on building what they called “an AI infrastructure,” or the system on which the various futuristic AI uses will be based, including health care, manufacturing, the environment, next-generation computing and customer services. The hope is to establish that AI infrastructure for Japan by 2030. It initially will be tailored for the Japanese market, leveraging Fujitsu’s decades-long experience here, but may later expand globally, and will utilize Nvidia’s GPUs, or graphics processing units, which are essential for AI, according to both sides.

Bloomberg reports: Oil was on track for the biggest weekly decline since late June, ahead of an OPEC+ meeting that’s expected to result in the return of more idled barrels, exacerbating concerns around oversupply. Brent (BZ=F) traded near $65 a barrel, down around 8% for the week, while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) was below $61. The alliance is scheduled to meet online on Sunday to make a decision on output for November, and could discuss fast-tracking supply hikes as the group seeks to reclaim market share. There are already early signs that global oversupply may be emerging in the Middle East, and the International Energy Agency expects the glut to swell to a record next year — in part due to the return of OPEC+ production. Some Wall Street banks predict Brent will slide into the $50s-a-barrel range. Read more here. Alibaba (BABA) continues to attract attention from hedge funds and retail investors with hope that the companies $250 billion hot streak is set to continue. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. Bloomberg reports: Its US-listed shares have more than doubled as investors buy into Beijing’s vision for self-reliance in the new tech landscape. And this poster child of China’s AI hopes remains more than 65% below its all-time high while major American hyperscaler stocks have peaked in recent months. With lingering caution over the Chinese economy and cutthroat market competition, short bets on Alibaba spiked last month. But a share price that’s still relatively attractive and low investment levels among global funds are seen leaving room for a prolonged rally. “We expect this underweight position to change,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at Gam Investment Management who still sees “significant upside” in Alibaba. “The sentiment could also be fueled by the fear of missing out following the strong share price rally.” The stock is still in a deep hole versus its 2020 peak following a yearslong selloff on regulatory crackdowns, internal upheaval and faltering Chinese consumption. Domestic price wars in the food-delivery space that briefly interrupted the recent rebound remain a concern as well. It’s trading at about 22 times estimated forward earnings in Hong Kong, double its three-year average, though just in line with the Hang Seng Tech Index. And it’s well below Alibaba’s peak level of 29 times, and current multiples for Amazon.com Inc (AMZN). and Microsoft Corp (MSFT). Read more here."

TSLA,Why did Tesla's discounts disappoint consumers and investors?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-teslas-discounts-disappoint-214111216.html,2025-10-08,"Tesla investors and consumers were disappointed after the company unveiled its long-awaited, less expensive versions of the Model 3 and Model Y. Intended to help Tesla reach a broader customer base and shed its reputation as a company that caters only to the wealthy, the new models are still not affordable enough and unlikely to trigger a buying spree, analysts said. The new models come just after the expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles, which is expected to strangle growth at EV makers this month and going forward. Teslaunveiled the vehicleson Tuesday on Chief Executive Elon Musk's social media site, X. TheModel 3 Standardhas a starting price of $36,990, just $5,500 less expensive than the existing version of the Model 3. TheModel Y Standardstarts at $39,990, $5,000 less than its pricier counterpart. Read more:Can Elon Musk get Tesla back on track? Here are four road bumps Tesla previously had plans to release a vehicle priced at less than $30,000 that never came to fruition. The new models may boost sales, said Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives, but they don't represent a drastic enough change. Cheaper models ""will be important to stimulate demand with the EV tax credit expiring,"" Ives wrote in a note Tuesday. ""But we are relatively disappointed with this launch as the price point is only $5,000 lower."" The EV leader has long teased the idea of making more affordable vehicles to allow people with lower incomes to go green. The price cuts for stripped-down versions of the models fail even tooffset the lossof the federal tax credit. On price, Tesla faces significant competition. A handful of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are on the market for $35,000 or less, even as auto tariffs threaten to raise the cost of cars and parts. The Hyundai Kona Electric and the Chevrolet Equinox EV both have starting prices between $32,000 and $34,000. The Nissan Leaf starts at $28,140. Read more:Here are the EVs you can buy for less than $35,000 Tesla's new Model 3 and Model Y vehicles will both have an all-electric range of 321 miles, about 40 miles less than the premium versions. The latest models are expected to hit the market before 2026. Industry insiders say the company will need to do more than lower prices by less than 13% togain backthe market share it lost to competitors. Tesla needs to repair the damage the brand took from Musk’s foray into politics, which rubbed many electric vehicle buyers the wrong way. It also needs to continue expanding its charging network and deliver on its self-driving technology. DespiteTesla's struggles, investors have remained optimistic that the company will regain its footing and eventually be bolstered by its self-driving robotaxi and humanoid robot ventures. Over the last 12 months, Tesla shares have surged by nearly 80%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index has risen by less than 30%. After Tuesday's announcement of the new vehicles, however, shares fell more than 4%. Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Discouragingly, Musk expects the upcoming quarters to be rough. Still, there are a few bright spots. The Energy Generation & Storage unit remains a core strength, and the Supercharger network continues to expand.Tesla has also launched its robotaxi service, though early reactions have been mixed.

The company is facing persistent cost pressures, higher medical utilization, and an elevated debt burden threatening near-term margin stability. The Zacks analyst expects the MCR to increase to 89.4% in 2025.

Shopify’s expanding international footprint with strong growth in Europe is a key catalyst. A rich partner base is helping SHOP expand its merchant base.
