GOOG,What's driving the latest bout of AI deals? Analyst answers.,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-driving-latest-bout-ai-213000938.html,2025-10-08,"Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Futurum CEO Daniel Newman discuss the AI milestones that could push Big Tech companies and hyperscalers even farther, includingmeeting compute capacity and demands, amid the latest round ofartificial intelligence deals and partnerships. Also catch Daniel Newman and Patrick Moorhead weigh in onwhether bubbles are forming in the AI trade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat? Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them. I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility. On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this. I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value. What do you make of that, Dan? These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future. They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future. The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future. And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out. The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold. So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend. But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."
GOOG,"Applovin rebounds, SCOTUS & Google, Elon Musk names xAI CFO",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/applovin-rebounds-scotus-google-elon-143439464.html,2025-10-08,"Market Catalysts hostJulie Hymanexamines what's driving interest in some of the top trending tickers on Yahoo Finance's platform, including,Applovin's(APP)gains, the US Supreme Court denying Alphabet's (GOOG,GOOGL) request to delay major changes to its Google Play store, and Elon Muskreportedlynames Anthony Armstrong — a Morgan Stanley (MS) veteran — as CFO of xAI (XAAI.PVT) and X. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Catalysts. Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We are watching App Lovin, Alphabet and XAI. First up, App Lovin, those shares sharply rebounding. They fell 14% on Monday after Bloomberg News reported the SEC is probing the data collection practices of the mobile advertising technology company. The agency is specifically looking to allegations that App Lovin violated service agreements with platform partners to push more targeted advertising. But city analyst Jason Bazne notes the regulator has not officially accused the company of wrongdoing. He views the absence of an 8K filing as a positive. It suggests the firm, he says, does not view this as a material risk. The shares up nearly 7% today. Next up, Alphabet, it's Google lost a Supreme Court bid to pause major changes to its Google Play App Store in an anti-trust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games. The Supreme Court without explanation denied Google's request to temporarily put part of a lower court ruling on hold. The company sought to block a requirement to allow rival App stores access to its app library and bar it from blocking downloads from competitors in Google Play. A Google spokesperson said the company is disappointed by the ruling and will continue to appeal. And finally XAI, Elon Musk's XA AI startup appointing a new chief financial officer. The Financial Times reporting Musk tapped former Morgan Stanley executive Anthony Armstrong to take the helmet as CFO at both XAI and X, the social media platform. The executive previously helped Musk complete the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter and was one of his lieutenants during his stint at Doge. Armstrong's predecessor left the company just months into the job.

GOOG,Should You Buy the Rebound in AppLovin Stock Today?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-rebound-applovin-stock-today-204738764.html,2025-10-08,"AppLovin (APP) stock has been rather volatile in recent sessions after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an investigation into the California-based ad-tech company. The probe centers on allegations that AppLovin violated service agreements with platform partners regarding data collection practices, specially examining whether the company improperly collected user identification data from major platforms like Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, and Google.

Is AMD Stock a Better Buy Than Nvidia Here? Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today! Following an initial SEC-driven decline, AppLovin shares recovered significantly on Tuesday and are currently up some 215% versus their year-to-date low in early April. Investors should consider buying the dip in APP stock today mostly because the firm’s fundamental business performance remains remarkably strong. AppLovin’s transformation from a mobile gaming app company into an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled ad-tech leader has been particularly successful, with its AXON 2.0 optimization engine serving as a major growth catalyst. Financial metrics support this success story, with the company maintaining robust fundamentals including a 33.35% profit margin and annual revenue of $4.7 billion. Its latest quarterly results demonstrate continued momentum with revenue increasing 77% year-over-year to $1.26 billion and net income soaring 164% to $820 million, further strengthening the case for owning AppLovin stock. AppLovin's expansion beyond mobile gaming into e-commerce advertising represents a significant growth opportunity, with the potential market estimated to be 20 times larger than its current focus. Another major reason to stick with APP shares for the longer term is its recent addition to the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) which further validates the firm’s market position and could drive institutional capital to it. In a recent interview withCNBC, Needham analyst Bernie McTernan also cited these tailwinds to assert that AppLovin stock is “rightfully” trading at a premium. McTernan is bullish on the company’s latest launch of its self-service platform and believes APP stock will follow a similar trajectory as TikTok that “went from a billion to two billion to five billion to nine billion.” Wall Street more broadly remains bullish on AppLovin stock as well. The consensus rating on APP shares currently sits at “Strong Buy” with price targets going as high as $860, indicating potential upside of nearly 35% from here.

GOOG,Google's Ad Tech Empire Faces Breakup Push In Court,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/googles-ad-tech-empire-faces-185959309.html,2025-10-08,"This article first appeared onGuruFocus. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) isonce again in the courtroom spotlightthis time facing a remedy trial that could reshape how it does business in digital advertising. The trial kicked off in late September in Alexandria, Virginia, just months after Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that Google had broken antitrust laws by using its ad tech arm to maintain monopoly power. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with MSFT. Is GOOG fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. The Justice Department and 17 states want the judge to go big asking her to force Google to sell its AdX ad exchange and make the auction system behind its publisher ad server, DFP, open-source. If that doesn't restore competition, the DOJ says Google should be required to sell DFP altogether. But experts warn that such a breakup would be messy and slow. Columbia professor Jason Nieh told the court it would be an undertaking of unprecedented complexity, possibly taking more than five years to complete. This comes just weeks after another ruling found Google held an illegal monopoly in online search, though the judge stopped short of forcing it to sell Chrome a move analysts saw as a win for the company. The ruling, if anything, is a gentle slap on the wrist, said Sara Owens, senior VP of analytics at AXM. She added that the real challenge for Google might come from the rise of AI search tools like OpenAI and Perplexity, which are already changing how people find information."
GOOG,This Underdog AI Stock Is Up 380% in the Past 6 Months. Analysts Think It Can Still Gain 70% From Here.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/underdog-ai-stock-380-past-184549484.html,2025-10-08,"Rezolve AI (RZLV) is a London, UK-based tech firm that deals with AI-driven commerce infrastructure, allowing companies to deploy shopping, pay, and even fulfillment agents that work autonomously using its Brain Suite platform. The company exists within the go-grow enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) commerce market, teaming up with names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and even Tether (USDTUSD). Rezolve presently has a market cap of a little over $1.3 billion, which makes it a mid-cap growth stock within the AI-commerce realm. In the last 52 weeks, RZLV shares have ranged between $1.07 and $8.45, recently trading around $6.20, showing a one-week rise of 24% and a swift recovery from year-earlier lows. The stock’s increase comes after management lifted revenue guidance and showed robust momentum on a company enterprise pipeline. Although Rezolve lags the overall Nasdaq Composite ($NASX), its recent pickup presages a return of institutional attention after several months of consolidation.

Is AMD Stock a Better Buy Than Nvidia Here? Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. Valuation continues to be speculative given Rezolve's accelerated scale. The firm currently experiences negative earnings with a negative profit margin, an approximately 6,959x price-sales (P/S) ratio, and a -0.74 debt-equity (D/E) ratio, a reflection of early-stage risk and dilution risk. Gross margins of 95.8% and increasing recurring revenue bode, nonetheless, for quick improvement in operating leverage when growth expenses normalize. Rezolve does not pay dividends; rather, it continues reinvesting for market share capture. Rezolve's first-half 2025 results easily beat Wall Street expectations. Revenue jumped 426% year-over-year (YoY) to $6.3 million, beating consensus $5.1 million estimates. Adjusted EBITDA at $17.7 million modestly beat the forecast $18.7 million loss, revealing better cost management despite phenomenal growth. The ringer was yearly recurring revenue. Rezolve reported over $90 million ARR year-to-date (YTD) and lifted full-year guidance to at least $150 million ARR exit rate for the year 2025—up significantly above earlier internal projections. Forward, management set a lofty 2026 ARR guidance of $500 million, attributing much of it to “strong demand momentum and visibility into its customer pipeline.” Enterprise adoption stepped up further. More than 100 worldwide customers now deploy Rezolve’s Brain Suite—among them H&M, Ferrero, Rakuten Group (RKUNY), Office Depot (ODP), Urban Outfitters (URBN), and Mango. The platform’s “Agentic Commerce” features deliver autonomous AI agents that search, transact, and personalize in real time, a defining next-generation retail tech differentiator. Professional-services partners such as Cognizant, PwC, and Wipro assist in deploying Rezolve’s systems at scale, expanding its reach further. CEO Daniel M. Wagner noted that “Brainpowa,” Rezolve’s proprietary technology that resulted, was at benchmark level with GPT-4 and Claude while having virtually zero hallucinations—putting the company on the map as an enterprise-class solution for commerce-enabled AI. At gross margins close to 96% and contracted ARR for the majority of 2025, Rezolve is structurally well-positioned for a pivot from concept to cash-flow traction during the next 12–18 months. RZLV has a “Strong Buy” rating consensus with target prices set between $7 and $15, with a median target of $10.42. Based on its current price of about 6.20, that suggests potential gains of nearly 70%. The high-end target of $15 suggests over 140% upside, a clear indication that there is confidence Rezolve’s trend bodes well for sustained re-rating should execution remain the case. Although volatility is elevated considering first-phase fundamentals, sentiment from analysts has shifted significantly bullish after the company raised its ARR guidance and growing enterprise partnerships. Ongoing demonstration of contract conversions along with margin scalability will remain integral catalysts for any sustained upside here after.

Wall Street likes Google's direction.Bank of America still thinks Alphabet is a good buy and has a price objective of $252. Google's stock is close to its 52-week high of $256, which suggests that investors believe in the company as it grows and comes up with new ideas. Google has expanded beyond AI. The company announced a $4 billion Arkansas data center that will create jobs and renewed a long-term deal with NBCUniversal to stream NBC content on YouTube TV. Alphabet is considering selling or spinning out Verily life sciences to focus on core growth areas. New competitors keep appearing.

GOOG,"Anthropic plans to open India office, eyes tie-up with billionaire Ambani",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-plans-open-india-office-162715425.html,2025-10-08,"Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei is in India this week, with plans to set up an office in Bengaluru and explore a partnership with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, TechCrunch has learned. The move signals the AI startup’s push to deepen its presence in its second-largest market after the U.S. Amodei is expected to visit Mumbai to meet Ambani and other senior executives at Reliance Industries, India’s most valuable company and the parent of the nation’s top telecom operator, Reliance Jio, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Anthropic has been in discussions with Reliance for some time over a potential partnership to expand access to its Claude AI assistant in India, the people said. India — the world’s second-largest online market after China, withmore than a billion internet subscribers— has emerged as an important growth region for Anthropic. Several Indian AI startups already use its Claude models in their products for both domestic and U.S. clients. India also accounts for the second-highest share of traffic to Claude’s website after the U.S., according to digital intelligence firmSimilarweb. In August, Reliance Industriespartnered with major technology companies, including its existing investors Google and Meta, to build AI infrastructure and enterprise solutions through its new unit, Reliance Intelligence. The Mumbai-headquartered conglomerate had also explored a potential collaboration with OpenAI, which rolled out its under-$5 ChatGPT plan in India earlier this year and announced plans to open an office in New Delhi later in 2025. That Reliance-OpenAI partnership was expected to be announced during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s planned visit to India last month, but Altman ultimately postponed the trip. Reliance Industries did not respond to a request for comment. TechCrunch has also reached out to OpenAI for comment. Alongside Mumbai, Amodei is visiting New Delhi to meet top lawmakers and senior federal government officials, sources said. He is also expected to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, two people familiar with his trip plans told TechCrunch. Later in the week, Amodei will be in Bengaluru to announce Anthropic’s office opening on Thursday, sources told TechCrunch. Anthropic EMEA head Guillaume Princen and startups chief Daniel Delaney are also accompanying him. Prominent venture funds, including Accel and Lightspeed, are also hosting dedicated sessions with Anthropic executives this week to share insights on how developers and startups can leverage Claude for their offerings. Anthropic’s Claude app, available on iOS and Android, recorded a 48% year-over-year increase in downloads in India in September, reaching about 767,000 installs this year, according to Appfigures. Consumer spending on the app in India surged 572% year-over-year, generating $195,000 in September alone, the data showed. The India figures, however, remain modest compared with those in the United States, where downloads rose 91% year-over-year and consumer spending jumped 604%. U.S. users spent $2.5 million on the Claude app in September, per Appfigures. Globally, the app saw 74% growth in downloads to 1.01 million and a 546% rise in consumer spending to $5.62 million in the same month. Unlike OpenAI, which aims to establish a sales and marketing setup while overseeing policy updates from New Delhi, Anthropic plans to target developers and startups with its office in Bengaluru. Anthropic is seeing its largest usage coming from India, a founder who works closely with the AI company told TechCrunch, requesting anonymity. Alongside Anthropic and OpenAI, Perplexity is also looking to tap India’s market. The company has partnered with Indian telecom operator Bharti Airtel to offer itsPerplexity Pro subscription to over 360 million Airtel customersfor 12 months. The AI search startup has also refined its product for local users, including bylaunching live earnings call transcriptsfor Indian stocks to attract more engagement from India. Anthropic did not respond to a request for comment."
GOOG,Open Compute Project Foundation and iMasons Develop Taxonomy for Carbon Disclosure,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-compute-project-foundation-imasons-154500095.html,2025-10-08,"New Specification for Embodied Carbon Harmonizes Reporting Across the DC Industry AUSTIN, Texas,Oct. 7, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- The Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), in collaboration with the iMasons Climate Accord (iCA), today unveiled theEmbodied Carbon Disclosure – OCP Base Specification, with contributions from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Schneider Electric and more, the first major work product from their alliance. This foundational specification establishes a common, open framework for reporting data center equipment carbon impact data. This framework is designed to reduce duplication, align reporting practices, and streamline carbon disclosure for both buyers and suppliers in the digital infrastructure ecosystem. Leveraging OCP's Community and OCP's ecosystems ability to impact the data center supply chain and iMasons reach with the end user community, this work is a crucial step in tackling one of the industry's greatest challenges, creating sustainable, and scalable digital infrastructure capable of meeting the requirements for AI and HPC from the data center to the edge. This specification directly responds to the industry's need for consistent, transparent carbon reporting. By harmonizing carbon disclosure requirements across stakeholders and eliminating duplicative data requests, the specification and provided template simplifies information sharing, accelerates supplier compliance, and empowers buyers with clear carbon insights that can be used to make a purchasing decision. A standard taxonomy for supplier carbon disclosures related to data center materials and equipment provides the industry an opportunity to build new tools and utilize existing sustainability solutions with a common data structure for reporting carbon impact and methodology applied to derive the result. ""The large AI data center buildout and expansion worldwide in front of us has the potential to have an enormous impact on our environment. The OCP Community is committed to ensure that any potential negative impacts are minimized. It was with this as a guiding factor that OCP established an alliance with iMasons Climate Accord, and are very pleased to see the initial fruits of the effort materialize. This new open carbon disclosure framework gives our members and the data center ecosystem a trusted, community-led standardized data carbon reporting format they need to make sustainability a central part of their purchasing and product development decisions,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation. The longer term goal of this effort between the Open Compute Project and iMasons is to be a catalyst to the industry to better build capabilities toward standardized carbon disclosure methodologies with increased rigor and stricter requirements for high quality carbon measurement practices. The current base specification is a step in this direction encouraging vendors to disclose the embodied carbon figure for a specific piece of data center infrastructure equipment (MEP - Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing or IT - Information Technology) or material stream, as well as the underlying methodologies and data sources that were used to calculate that carbon figure. The specification is purposely flexible to allow a variety of carbon measurement tools, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), CIBSE's TM65 methodology, Product Carbon Footprint, or Economic Input-Output modeling. As the supplier community builds capabilities around carbon measurement, this specification will help procurement organizations to uncover and evaluate the types and quality of empirical data that their suppliers are using to quantify the carbon impact of their products. ""At iMasons, we believe that uniting the industry around open, transparent standards is the only way to achieve meaningful progress on sustainability. This collaboration with OCP is a major step forward in giving our respective communities — from suppliers to end users — the clarity and confidence to make carbon-aware decisions. By aligning on a common framework, we are not only reducing complexity, but also creating the foundation for scalable, sustainable digital infrastructure that can responsibly power the AI era,"" said Santiago Suinaga, CEO Infrastructure Masons. ""Critical to the success of this effort is the well-established multi-vendor data center supply chain provided by the OCP vendor member community. Upon delivering an open framework such as this new specification along with a set of best practices, the OCP members typically move rapidly to adopt and align their product offerings. As the catalog of products produced with embodied carbon disclosure information for showcase in the OCP Marketplace increases, end user demand is stimulated for products that comply, "" said Rob Coyle, Director of Technical Programs at the Open Compute Project Foundation. The OCP and iMasons Communities will begin leveraging the potential of the Embodied Carbon Disclosure Specification. Later this year, the Carbon Disclosure Ready™product recognition icon will begin to appear in the OCP Marketplace alongside products where carbon reporting is available. This identification will help buyers easily recognize products with carbon reporting that complies with the OCP Embodied Carbon Disclosure Specification. ""This effort between the Open Compute Project and the iMasons Climate Accord comes at a time when the data center industry is undergoing tremendous change, providing an ideal time for introducing new buying behaviours. Tackling a very important problem, the carbon impact of data center equipment by providing a common format for reporting carbon content with an eye to evolving a standard carbon reporting methodology is a necessary and simple 1st step that the industry can take together. Once we have a foundation established to compare carbon content reporting across the industry we can believe this will lead to better decision making and accountability."" said Ashish Nadkarni Group VP and GM of Worldwide Infrastructure Research at IDC.

GOOG,Strategy Ranks Among Top Five U.S. Corporate Treasuries With $80B in Bitcoin Holdings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strategy-ranks-among-top-five-153222648.html,2025-10-08,"Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) continues to cement its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin, ranking fifth among U.S. corporate treasuries with approximately $80 billion in digital assets, according to company data and recent regulatory filings. A chart publishedby the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla. According to thecompany’s latest Form 8-K filingwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion. The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC. The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date. The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet. The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include: • $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) • $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) • $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) • $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD) • $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR) The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions. As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’sdigital-assetcarrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset. The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm. With Bitcoin’s market value continuing to climb, Strategy’s holdings now place it firmly among the top five U.S. corporations by total treasury size — a rare achievement for a firm whose reserves consist primarily of digital assets.

The key highlights from JNUC 2025 include: Platform API ecosystem to power a more dynamic, flexible Apple experience With the launch of its new Platform API ecosystem, Jamf is evolving its platform into a more dynamic and flexible foundation for innovation.
