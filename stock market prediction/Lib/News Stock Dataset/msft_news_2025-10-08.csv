MSFT,What's driving the latest bout of AI deals? Analyst answers.,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-driving-latest-bout-ai-213000938.html,2025-10-08,"Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Futurum CEO Daniel Newman discuss the AI milestones that could push Big Tech companies and hyperscalers even farther, includingmeeting compute capacity and demands, amid the latest round ofartificial intelligence deals and partnerships. Also catch Daniel Newman and Patrick Moorhead weigh in onwhether bubbles are forming in the AI trade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat? Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them. I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility. On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this. I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value. What do you make of that, Dan? These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future. They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future. The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future. And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out. The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold. So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend. But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."
MSFT,"AlphaSense acquires Y Combinator-backed Carousel, an AI assistant for Excel",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alphasense-acquires-y-combinator-backed-130001200.html,2025-10-08,"Fintech companyAlphaSensehas acquired Carousel, an AI assistant for building financial models in Excel. AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko told BI that ""AI isn't replacing analysts, it's giving them superpowers."" AlphaSense says it just hit $500 million in annual revenue and has 6,500 corporate clients. As Silicon Valley chases the next frontier in technology, one classic tool still reigns supreme:Microsoft Excel. That's why business intelligence platform AlphaSense is acquiring Carousel, the New York-based startup behind an AI assistant that generates financial spreadsheets and buildsmodels in Excel. AlphaSense declined to disclose specific financial details about the deal, but AlphaSense CEO Jack Kokko told Business Insider in an interview that the company just crossed $500 million in annual recurring revenue and now has 6,500 corporate clients. AlphaSense launched in 2011 and is valued at $4 billion, according to PitchBook. Kokko said the Carousel's entire team will be integrated with AlphaSense, and they'll be focused on developing AI-powered spreadsheet generation tools. Carousel, which was part of Y Combinator's Winter 2024 batch, was founded by Daniel Wolf and Jude Rizzo in 2023. ""Carousel eliminates the most tedious parts of an analyst's workflow — extracting data from PDFs and presentations, formatting models, building formulas, and explaining complex logic,"" AlphaSense said in an announcement of the acquisition. Kokko said that the company has seen ""hypergrowth"" over the last four quarters due to the tailwinds of generative AI. The Carousel deal follows the company's acquisition of Tegus, a provider of research, financial data, and workflow tools, for $930 million in 2024. That acquisition shifted AlphaSense's client base more towardfinancial services firms, Kokko said. So, the company saw opportunity in automating more aspects of these firms' work —especially modeling. Right now, a typical AlphaSense user might leverage the platform to pull anywhere from dozens to thousands of data points from original documents to manually build a model. The company says the integration of Carousel will allow those same users to automate many of those steps through a conversational interface. Kokko said the integration of Carousel is more likely to impact the work of its clients' entry-level workers. ""At least in the early stages, this technology will mostly be used by junior and midlevel employees — the ones actually doing the modeling today,"" he said. ""AI isn't replacing analysts — it's giving them superpowers."" Generative AI, Kokko said, is quickly changing the way work gets done in the financial services industry — much like the way Excel rapidly expanded the number of analysts in the industry. ""It didn't replace analysts — it created an explosion in the number of analysts, "" he said about Excel. ""This will do the same, letting people model more scenarios in less time.""

MSFT,Dizzying deal delirium: How the AI bubble bursts,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dizzying-deal-delirium-ai-bubble-205337503.html,2025-10-08,"So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, whileNvidiais investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also countsMicrosoftas one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoftaccountedfor almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su hasdefendedAMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said heexpectsthere to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.”Amazonfounder and executive chairman Jeff Bezoscalledthe current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI,warnedthat “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reportsestimatethat AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalestnotesthat “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanovapoints outthat after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreakingreport from Applesuggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” Arecent studyfrom MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations consideredhad achieved zero returnon investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently aftertelling Axios,“AI could wipe outhalfof all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy atMcKinsey& Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbookreportedthat nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23%in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such asAndreessenHorowitzandY Combinator, on AI startups and themindbogglingvaluationsof those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft,Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI iscommittedto investing $300 billion in computing power withOracleover the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation hasalmost doubledfrom $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recentreportingby CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Anotherreportsays the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk haveeach raised concernsabout the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model,provided a recent exampleof what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is notdifficult to imaginea major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerfulWashington Postop-ed, Bethany McLeanpoignantly recallsthe overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classicExtraordinaryPopularDelusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs ofFortune.

MSFT,OpenAI Brings Apps To ChatGPT In Major DevDay Push,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-brings-apps-chatgpt-major-190013366.html,2025-10-08,"This article first appeared onGuruFocus. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),just gave ChatGPT a major upgrade. At its DevDay 2025 event in San Francisco, CEO Sam Altman announced the new Apps SDK, which lets users access third-party apps right inside ChatGPT no switching tabs required. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with MSFT. Is MSFT fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator. Figma (FIG) was one of the first apps showcased, and its stock jumped 10% by the end of the keynote. Other early integrations include Canva, Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG)(Z), and Coursera (NYSE:COUR), with more like DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Booking.com (NASDAQ:BKNG) coming soon.

Altman summed it up simply: Software that used to take months to build can now be built in minutes."
MSFT,This Underdog AI Stock Is Up 380% in the Past 6 Months. Analysts Think It Can Still Gain 70% From Here.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/underdog-ai-stock-380-past-184549484.html,2025-10-08,"Rezolve AI (RZLV) is a London, UK-based tech firm that deals with AI-driven commerce infrastructure, allowing companies to deploy shopping, pay, and even fulfillment agents that work autonomously using its Brain Suite platform. The company exists within the go-grow enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) commerce market, teaming up with names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and even Tether (USDTUSD). Rezolve presently has a market cap of a little over $1.3 billion, which makes it a mid-cap growth stock within the AI-commerce realm. In the last 52 weeks, RZLV shares have ranged between $1.07 and $8.45, recently trading around $6.20, showing a one-week rise of 24% and a swift recovery from year-earlier lows. The stock’s increase comes after management lifted revenue guidance and showed robust momentum on a company enterprise pipeline. Although Rezolve lags the overall Nasdaq Composite ($NASX), its recent pickup presages a return of institutional attention after several months of consolidation. This Crypto and AI Stock Just Got a Massive New Street-High Price Target That Implies Shares Could Double in the Next Year If You Love Dividends, Here Are 3 High-Yield Stocks to Buy Now AMD Is Soaring on an OpenAI Deal. Is AMD Stock a Better Buy Than Nvidia Here? Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today! Valuation continues to be speculative given Rezolve's accelerated scale. The firm currently experiences negative earnings with a negative profit margin, an approximately 6,959x price-sales (P/S) ratio, and a -0.74 debt-equity (D/E) ratio, a reflection of early-stage risk and dilution risk. Gross margins of 95.8% and increasing recurring revenue bode, nonetheless, for quick improvement in operating leverage when growth expenses normalize. Rezolve does not pay dividends; rather, it continues reinvesting for market share capture. Rezolve's first-half 2025 results easily beat Wall Street expectations. Revenue jumped 426% year-over-year (YoY) to $6.3 million, beating consensus $5.1 million estimates. Adjusted EBITDA at $17.7 million modestly beat the forecast $18.7 million loss, revealing better cost management despite phenomenal growth. The ringer was yearly recurring revenue. Rezolve reported over $90 million ARR year-to-date (YTD) and lifted full-year guidance to at least $150 million ARR exit rate for the year 2025—up significantly above earlier internal projections. Forward, management set a lofty 2026 ARR guidance of $500 million, attributing much of it to “strong demand momentum and visibility into its customer pipeline.” Enterprise adoption stepped up further. More than 100 worldwide customers now deploy Rezolve’s Brain Suite—among them H&M, Ferrero, Rakuten Group (RKUNY), Office Depot (ODP), Urban Outfitters (URBN), and Mango. The platform’s “Agentic Commerce” features deliver autonomous AI agents that search, transact, and personalize in real time, a defining next-generation retail tech differentiator. Professional-services partners such as Cognizant, PwC, and Wipro assist in deploying Rezolve’s systems at scale, expanding its reach further. CEO Daniel M. Wagner noted that “Brainpowa,” Rezolve’s proprietary technology that resulted, was at benchmark level with GPT-4 and Claude while having virtually zero hallucinations—putting the company on the map as an enterprise-class solution for commerce-enabled AI. At gross margins close to 96% and contracted ARR for the majority of 2025, Rezolve is structurally well-positioned for a pivot from concept to cash-flow traction during the next 12–18 months. RZLV has a “Strong Buy” rating consensus with target prices set between $7 and $15, with a median target of $10.42. Based on its current price of about 6.20, that suggests potential gains of nearly 70%. The high-end target of $15 suggests over 140% upside, a clear indication that there is confidence Rezolve’s trend bodes well for sustained re-rating should execution remain the case. Although volatility is elevated considering first-phase fundamentals, sentiment from analysts has shifted significantly bullish after the company raised its ARR guidance and growing enterprise partnerships. Ongoing demonstration of contract conversions along with margin scalability will remain integral catalysts for any sustained upside here after.

MSFT,Hedge fund billionaire says 2025 is ‘so much more potentially explosive than 1999’ because of the way bull markets always end,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-fund-billionaire-says-2025-183848954.html,2025-10-08,"Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CIO of Tudor Investment Corporation, has raised alarms about the state of financial markets in 2025, drawing pointed comparisons to the explosive tech-driven boom of 1999, while clarifying that today’s environment could be “so much more potentially explosive.” The reason why has to do with what the market veteran knows about how bull markets always play out. Speaking to Andrew Ross Sorkin of theNew York Times’ DealBook onCNBC’sSquawk Boxahead of the upcoming Robin Hood Foundation investor conference, Jones described today’s investment climate as uncannily similar to the one that preceded the 2000 dotcom bust. “It feels exactly like 1999,” he said, implying that the market was acting like the famous Prince song with the lyrics, “Party like it’s 1999.” He urged investors to position themselves like it’s October 1999, when theNasdaqdoubled in a matter of months before collapsing, a pattern Jones sees as increasingly plausible today. The difference is that this could be even worse than the dotcom bust, he said. Jones told Sorkin his concerns had to do with investor behavior in every bull market, specifically at the end, when the cliff is nearing and nobody is sure where it is. Jones underscored that in every bull market, the “greatest price appreciation is always the 12 months preceding the top,” like what happened after October 1999. For investors, he said, the challenge is timing: “If you don’t play it, you’re missing out on the juice. If you do play it, you…have to have really happy feet because there will be a really, really bad end to it,” he said, seeming to refer to theAmerican football phrasefor when a quarterback is antsy and tiptoeing around the pocket, rather than standing their ground. “If anything, now is so much more potentially explosive than 1999,” Jones argued, citing the backdrop of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. He noted the Fed is set up for several rate cuts, with monetary policy taking the economy to a real interest rate of zero, meaning incentives to invest and spend given such a low cost of capital. In terms of fiscal policy, the Congress had a budget surplus in 1999 and today it has a 6% budget deficit. “That fiscal/monetary combination is a brew that we haven’t seen since, I guess, the postwar period, early ’50s, something like that,” he said. “And that was crazy times, right? Coming out of the war.” Still, Jones insisted he wasn’t calling a bubble or predicting a crash. “I’m not suggesting that the train is going to crash,” he clarified. “I’m suggesting that we’re in a period that’s conducive for massive price appreciation in a variety of assets.” Where Jones did see a bubble was in sovereign debt, labeling government bonds the “biggest bubble,” with massive global deficits staved off, for now, by an ongoing easing cycle and anticipatory flows into fixed income. “We’re kind of boldly going where no man has ever gone before,” he said, borrowing aStar Trekreference to capture the unprecedented mix of easy money and ballooning sovereign obligations. He foresees a reckoning when the current cycle of rate cuts ends and “all that demand has been pushed forward.” When asked about the “circularity” of financing in the AI space, withNvidia, OpenAI, AMD,Oracle,Microsoft, and others all having somewhat interwoven data center deals with one another, Jones agreed. “The circularity makes me nervous, I would say.” But he added that in broad terms, the way he thinks of it is the markets are mostly concerned about inflation, and gold is a big winner. (The precious metal in fact has continually set record highs in 2025,nearing $4,000 an ounce as of Monday.) Jones did not mention the company Nvidia throughout his interview. Jones also zoomed out for a minute to talk about the race for the fourth quarter. “The race, realistically, is certainly to the end of the year, because that’s when everyone marks institutionally, and then you have to figure out what’s going to go on in next year,” he said. These remarks echoed a separate interview given toFortunebyBank of AmericaResearch’s senior analyst Vivek Arya. “I think we are at that point of the year, and this isn’t just specific to [2025], we have seen this in prior years right around this time where people get justifiably very nervous about what is going to be the amount of spending next year,” Arya said. As soon as the new year starts, Arya added, “people get comfortable with spending and then it starts to get back to fundamentals again.” He added that there’s a “pecularity” about the fourth-quarter season “where people naturally get nervous.”Fortunehas separately reported onOwen Lamont’s “panic season” and “harvest time” thesis, which is that markets suffer from too many traders going on vacation between August and October, a legacy that dates back to America’s agricultural roots and how markets functioned around the harvesting of certain crops. For now, Jones told CNBC, the music is still playing. But the warning is clear: “History rhymes a lot.” For investors, 2025 could be a year defined by explosive gains—and the risk that the end of the party arrives sooner, and more violently, than most expect. He added he’s not certain whether 1999 will be entirely replaced, “but I think all the ingredients are in place, and certainly from a trading standpoint…it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck. It’s probably not a chicken, right?” This story was originally featured onFortune.com"
MSFT,"OpenAI builds apps into ChatGPT, in a bold bid to make AI the ‘universal interface’ to our digital lives",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-builds-apps-chatgpt-bold-172128403.html,2025-10-08,"Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition: Jeff Bezos calls AI a ‘bubble’ of a kind…Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows an alarming self-awareness…Microsoftdemonstrates an AI-powered bioterrorism “zero day”…and is the U.S. economy now just “one big bet on AI”?I want to tie together two big pieces of news from yesterday that, at first, might not seem related, other than that they both involve OpenAI. The first was the announcement of a major new strategic partnership between OpenAI and chipmaker AMD. The deal will see AMD provide its M4150 graphic processing units (GPUs) to OpenAI’s data centers beginning in the second half of 2026. OpenAI will use these chips primarily for inference—that is, running its AI products such as ChatGPT, Sora, and its API, rather than for training new models. Eventually, OpenAI has committed to purchasing six gigawatts worth of AMD chips, and AMD has granted OpenAI warrants that could, if certain conditions are met, give OpenAI rights to up to 10% of AMD’s shares. AMD’s stock initially jumped by more than a third on the news, before eventually closing up about 26% for the day. My colleague Sharon Goldman had more on the dealhere.The second news item yesterday was OpenAI’s announcement of anew apps feature in ChatGPT. This essentially allows ChatGPT to easily call on other services, such asSpotifyfor music, or Expedia for travel inquiries, and deliver responses from those apps directly into the chat. At first, this might seem like OpenAI taking aim at the market for existing digital assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and theGoogleAssistant. All of these assistants already interact with third-party apps—Amazoncalled these interactions “skills”—to perform functions from the voice-based assistant. ChatGPT has already won over a lot of users—its 700 million active weekly users tops the 600 million “Alexa-enabled” devices that Amazon claims to have. And this move could be seen as a way to prevent the upgraded, LLM-powered versions of these other digital assistants from stealing back any market share.But I think something else, something far more profound, is actually afoot. OpenAI wants ChatGPT to become nothing less than the new, universal interface to our digital lives. And while the idea of “ambient intelligence” (always-on AI that we can summon at any time, by voice or the touch of a button) has been around for a while, Siri and Alexa never lived up to that vision. They simply weren’t capable enough. Now OpenAI seems to think that with ChatGPT—perhaps embedded in whatever piece of hardware CEO Sam Altman and formerAppledesigner Jonny Ive are cooking up (more on that in the news section below)—it can make ambient intelligence a reality. Forget AI-enabled browsers, like Perplexity’s Comet or Gemini in Chrome. If apps in ChatGPT become a big enough ecosystem, you won’t need a browser at all. (Although, hedging its bets, OpenAI is reportedly also at work on an AI-enabled browser.) This is the great “platform shift” people have been anticipating since ChatGPT debuted. Now the only question is how quickly and how completely consumers and businesses will move to this model. What’s clear though is that if ChatGPT does become the universal interface to all things digital for a substantial number of users, OpenAI is going to need a lot more computing power. Already the company complains that it can’t get enough GPUs fromNvidia, the dominant AI chipmaker, to serve existing needs, let alone future ones. Hence deals like the one it signed with AMD. While it is true that part of the logic of the AMD deal is to ensure OpenAI is not completely beholden to Nvidia, a lot of this is simply about ensuring OpenAI has enough computing power to serve its existing user base as they consume more and more tokens thanks to things like the ability to tap apps directly from ChatGPT. Altman went out of his way on social media to explain that the AMD partnership was “incremental to our work with Nvidia” and that “the world needs much more compute.” (Ultimately, OpenAI will probably seek to design its own AI chips for inference—as many of the hyperscalers have done. Altman seemed to be laying the groundwork for this during a recent swing through Asia where he met withSamsungandSKHynix to strike deals on high-bandwidth memory chips and reportedly held discussion with leading foundry operator TSMC.) There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the AI infrastructure boom. It’s not clear where the energy to power the250 gigawatts’ worth of AI computeOpenAI has talked about building by 2033 is going to come from. It’s not clear how OpenAI will be able to monetize its users in a way that will pay for all of that compute. It’s not clear if the platform shift OpenAI is trying to midwife will happen fast enough and fully enough to justify that level of compute in that timeframe. But, if Altman is right, and AI is essentially the new interface to all computing—a view Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also endorsed—then building out this kind of spending begins to seem less like an insane gamble, and more like a sound investment. That’s the bull case for AI infrastructure that was sounded last weekin a notefrom analysts atBank of America. They said there are historical precedents for this kind of infrastructure spending when a major platform shift is underway. They looked at the build-out of 4G wireless infrastructure in the decade between 2010 and 2020 and noted that global telecoms firms spent $1.3 trillion dollars on installing new equipment during that decade to support the technology. What’s more consumers then spent $3.6 trillion upgrading their smartphones to take advantage of 4G. Of course, not every telecom operator came out of that decade well—there were several bankruptcies, and the debt needed to build all that 4G infrastructure was a major driver of widespread consolidation in the industry. Meanwhile, much of the value of the 4G shift accrued to the social media companies and apps, not to the telecom providers, which emerged from the infrastructure boom as arguably less healthy businesses than they had been going in: The average debt-to-equity ratio in the industry more than doubled, for instance. But most companies survived, and the infrastructure did get used. It wasn’t Tulip Mania. We’ll see what happens this time. With that, here’s more AI news.

MSFT,Cloud marketplace sales set to skyrocket by 2030,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-marketplace-sales-set-skyrocket-155307704.html,2025-10-08,"This story was originally published onCIO Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free dailyCIO Dive newsletter. Enterprise software sales through hyperscaler cloud marketplaces are set to increasemore than five times,from $30 billion in 2024 to $163 billion by 2030, according toresearch fromOmdiapublished Monday. The exponential sales growth reflects enterprise adoption of marketplace procurement, as well as increased agentic AI sales. Enterprise customers are engaging in morestrategic marketplace procurementand cloud commitment negotiations that incorporate a broader group of vendor products into their cloud strategies, Omdia researchers found. Increased multiyear cloud commitments are driving enterprise software sales. Omdia estimates close to$470 billionin upfront cloud commitments exist across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. “Hyperscaler marketplaces continue to see rapid momentum as a route to market for vendors across the technology industry,”Alastair Edwards, chief analyst at Omdia, said in a news release accompanying the research. Enterprises turn to hyperscaler marketplaces in a bid to expand their access to services and products as agentic AI drives further cloud investments. Three main technology categories will make up nearly two-thirds of total spending through hyperscaler marketplaces, Omdia found: Infrastructure software: $10.5 billion DevOps: $9.1 billion Business applications: $9.1 billion AI will also drive marketplace spending. Growth of multiagent protocols will push AI marketplace spendto nearly $25 billion, at a 37% compound annual growth rate, Omdia reported. Microsoft, Google and AWS are allinvesting billions in cloud and AI buildoutsto support enterprise customers. Simultaneously, as enterprises’ cloud maturity advances, agentic AI will create more opportunities for businesses, according to Omdia. “The hyperscalers are competing hard to win the race as a channel for agentic AI through their agent marketplaces, because this accounts for an ever-greater proportion of cloud consumption,”Edwardsnoted in the release. Enterprise channel partners are also adapting to hyperscaler marketplaces, often with support from the major providers themselves. Omdia predicts thatby 2030, channel partners will facilitate nearly 60%of all marketplace transactions. Channel partners will serve a distinct role in helping enterprise customers purchase across different cloud marketplaces.

MSFT,Open Compute Project Foundation and iMasons Develop Taxonomy for Carbon Disclosure,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-compute-project-foundation-imasons-154500095.html,2025-10-08,"New Specification for Embodied Carbon Harmonizes Reporting Across the DC Industry AUSTIN, Texas,Oct. 7, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- The Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), in collaboration with the iMasons Climate Accord (iCA), today unveiled theEmbodied Carbon Disclosure – OCP Base Specification, with contributions from Google, Meta, Microsoft, Schneider Electric and more, the first major work product from their alliance. This foundational specification establishes a common, open framework for reporting data center equipment carbon impact data. This framework is designed to reduce duplication, align reporting practices, and streamline carbon disclosure for both buyers and suppliers in the digital infrastructure ecosystem. Leveraging OCP's Community and OCP's ecosystems ability to impact the data center supply chain and iMasons reach with the end user community, this work is a crucial step in tackling one of the industry's greatest challenges, creating sustainable, and scalable digital infrastructure capable of meeting the requirements for AI and HPC from the data center to the edge. This specification directly responds to the industry's need for consistent, transparent carbon reporting. By harmonizing carbon disclosure requirements across stakeholders and eliminating duplicative data requests, the specification and provided template simplifies information sharing, accelerates supplier compliance, and empowers buyers with clear carbon insights that can be used to make a purchasing decision. A standard taxonomy for supplier carbon disclosures related to data center materials and equipment provides the industry an opportunity to build new tools and utilize existing sustainability solutions with a common data structure for reporting carbon impact and methodology applied to derive the result. ""The large AI data center buildout and expansion worldwide in front of us has the potential to have an enormous impact on our environment. The OCP Community is committed to ensure that any potential negative impacts are minimized. It was with this as a guiding factor that OCP established an alliance with iMasons Climate Accord, and are very pleased to see the initial fruits of the effort materialize. This new open carbon disclosure framework gives our members and the data center ecosystem a trusted, community-led standardized data carbon reporting format they need to make sustainability a central part of their purchasing and product development decisions,"" said George Tchaparian, CEO at the Open Compute Project Foundation. The longer term goal of this effort between the Open Compute Project and iMasons is to be a catalyst to the industry to better build capabilities toward standardized carbon disclosure methodologies with increased rigor and stricter requirements for high quality carbon measurement practices. The current base specification is a step in this direction encouraging vendors to disclose the embodied carbon figure for a specific piece of data center infrastructure equipment (MEP - Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing or IT - Information Technology) or material stream, as well as the underlying methodologies and data sources that were used to calculate that carbon figure. The specification is purposely flexible to allow a variety of carbon measurement tools, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), CIBSE's TM65 methodology, Product Carbon Footprint, or Economic Input-Output modeling. As the supplier community builds capabilities around carbon measurement, this specification will help procurement organizations to uncover and evaluate the types and quality of empirical data that their suppliers are using to quantify the carbon impact of their products. ""At iMasons, we believe that uniting the industry around open, transparent standards is the only way to achieve meaningful progress on sustainability. This collaboration with OCP is a major step forward in giving our respective communities — from suppliers to end users — the clarity and confidence to make carbon-aware decisions. By aligning on a common framework, we are not only reducing complexity, but also creating the foundation for scalable, sustainable digital infrastructure that can responsibly power the AI era,"" said Santiago Suinaga, CEO Infrastructure Masons. ""Critical to the success of this effort is the well-established multi-vendor data center supply chain provided by the OCP vendor member community. Upon delivering an open framework such as this new specification along with a set of best practices, the OCP members typically move rapidly to adopt and align their product offerings. As the catalog of products produced with embodied carbon disclosure information for showcase in the OCP Marketplace increases, end user demand is stimulated for products that comply, "" said Rob Coyle, Director of Technical Programs at the Open Compute Project Foundation. The OCP and iMasons Communities will begin leveraging the potential of the Embodied Carbon Disclosure Specification. Later this year, the Carbon Disclosure Ready™product recognition icon will begin to appear in the OCP Marketplace alongside products where carbon reporting is available. This identification will help buyers easily recognize products with carbon reporting that complies with the OCP Embodied Carbon Disclosure Specification. ""This effort between the Open Compute Project and the iMasons Climate Accord comes at a time when the data center industry is undergoing tremendous change, providing an ideal time for introducing new buying behaviours. Tackling a very important problem, the carbon impact of data center equipment by providing a common format for reporting carbon content with an eye to evolving a standard carbon reporting methodology is a necessary and simple 1st step that the industry can take together. Once we have a foundation established to compare carbon content reporting across the industry we can believe this will lead to better decision making and accountability."" said Ashish Nadkarni Group VP and GM of Worldwide Infrastructure Research at IDC.

A chart publishedby the firm compares Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the cash reserves of leading corporations, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Only those four companies hold larger total treasuries, with Strategy’s $80 billion Bitcoin position outpacing the cash and short-term investments of major players such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla. According to thecompany’s latest Form 8-K filingwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Strategy’s aggregate Bitcoin holdings stood at 640,031 BTC as of October 5, with a total fair value of $47.35 billion. The firm did not purchase additional Bitcoin during the reporting period from September 29 to October 5, maintaining its average purchase price of $73,983 per BTC. The company’s balance sheet carrying value for digital assets totaled $73.21 billion as of September 30, while fair value appreciation for the third quarter reached $3.9 billion, marking one of the company’s largest unrealized quarterly gains to date. The appreciation reflects Bitcoin’s sustained rally through Q3 2025. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense, noting the accounting implications of its Bitcoin-centric balance sheet. The filing further detailed updates to Strategy’s extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, which collectively represent about $63.9 billion in potential capital issuance. These include: • $2.1 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (STRF) • $4.2 billion in Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC) • $21 billion in 8% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) • $4.2 billion in 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD) • $21 billion in Class A common stock (MSTR) The company reported no new share issuances during the period, noting that any proceeds from potential future sales would be presented net of commissions. As of the end of Q3 2025, Strategy’sdigital-assetcarrying value remained $73.21 billion, with a corresponding deferred-tax liability of $7.43 billion. The figures reaffirm Strategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin as its core corporate reserve asset. The financial disclosures were internally prepared and reviewed by KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm.

MSFT,Can Nebius' Data Center Expansion Drive Growth Amid Rising Competition?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nebius-data-center-expansion-drive-152800799.html,2025-10-08,"Nebius Group N.V.NBIS is scaling aggressively to capture the surging demand for AI compute, positioning itself as a fast-emerging player in the global AI infrastructure market. The company recently reported more than doubling its revenues from the first quarter and becoming EBITDA positive in its core AI infrastructure business ahead of projections. Nebius’ rapid expansion of data centers is key to its growth story. By the end of this year, the company expects to secure 220 megawatts of connected power, either active or ready for GPU deployment. This expansion includes major data centers in New Jersey and Finland. Two additional greenfield data center projects in the US are nearing completion, signaling the company’s commitment to scale aggressively and meet the surge in AI compute demand. Overall, Nebius is on track to secure more than 1 gigawatt of power by the end of 2026. Also, Nebius announced plans to launch its first major GPU cluster facility in the UK, located just outside London. The site is expected to come online in the early fourth quarter, marking a significant milestone in the company’s global expansion. Nebius anticipates being the first provider to deliver Nvidia’s B300 GPUs to the U.K. market. Moreover, the company recently closed a deal withMicrosoft CorporationMSFT for $17.4 billion, which involves NBIS providing dedicated GPU capacity to the latter from the new data center in Vineland, NJ, beginning later this year through 2031. The company is focusing on building a global footprint, with capacity in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. In June, Nebius launched NVIDIA GB200 capacity in Europe and deployed Blackwell Ultra GPUs in the UK.  In the first quarter of 2025, the company added three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel. With Blackwell GPUs entering the market at scale and data center capacity ramping up significantly, it expects a sharp increase in sales by year-end. Driven by these factors, Nebius has updated its year-end annualized run rate (ARR) guidance from the previous $700 million–$1 billion range to a new $900 million–$1.1 billion range. However, scaling aggressively (multiple data centers in various regions) involves execution risk. Moreover, stiff competition and broader macroeconomic uncertainties could pose challenges to NBIS’ growth trajectory. Nebius competes with technology giants like Microsoft andCoreWeave, Inc.CRWV. Microsoft remains a dominant force in technology, leading cloud infrastructure through Azure while rapidly expanding in AI infrastructure. Its deep partnership with OpenAI has established Azure as a leading platform for AI workloads, reinforced by AI integration across Office, GitHub and Dynamics. The company has transformed every Azure region into an AI-first environment equipped with liquid cooling technology, adding more than 2 gigawatts (GW) of new data center capacity over the past year and operating more than 400 data centers across 70 regions worldwide. Microsoft projects Azure growth of 37% for fiscal first-quarter 2026. CoreWeave continues to scale its data center infrastructure at a rapid pace. By the end of the second quarter, the company had 470 megawatts (MW) of active power and expanded its total contracted capacity to 2.2 GW, targeting more than 900 MW of active power by year-end. Its aggressive expansion includes a $6 billion data center investment in Lancaster, PA, and a joint venture project in Kenilworth, NJ, to meet rising demand. It has launched RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU instances, offering faster AI performance and cost-efficient scalability. CRWV continues to ramp up investments in data centers and server infrastructure to keep pace with the ongoing traction in customer demand.

MSFT,Are C3.ai's High-Profile Partners Enough to Offset Missteps?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/c3-ais-high-profile-partners-151900317.html,2025-10-08,"C3.ai, Inc.AI stumbled at the start of fiscal 2026, with the first quarter’s revenues declining year over year by 19%, reflecting softer demand for demonstration licenses and disruption caused by organizational changes and leadership transitions. However, this setback did not discourage the company; but rather boosted its confidence in moving forward on capitalizing on the opportunities set for an Artificial Intelligence software provider like itself.C3.ai is not only enhancing its product offerings by sidestepping the current market trends, but also opting for opportunities through other effective strategies, like collaborations or partnerships. During the first quarter of 2026, the company’s business accounted for 90% of its revenues through alliances with heavyweights such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and McKinsey QuantumBlack. These collaborations not only amplify C3.ai’s go-to-market reach but also embed its Agentic AI platform more deeply into the enterprise fabric, supporting use cases ranging from defense logistics to manufacturing optimization.The company highlighted some advancements in its partnerships during the first quarter of fiscal 2026. These include Nucor's commitment expansion into a multi-year partnership to build an enterprise-wide AI program across its facilities, wherein C3.ai will support and optimize everyday planning, inventory and scheduling decisions. Besides, a global leader in chemicals, Qemetica, debuted its enterprise-scale AI program with C3.ai. Additionally, America’s top military shipbuilder, HII, is also extending its partnership with C3.ai to accelerate throughput at Ingalls and Newport News, with the goal of strengthening U.S. Navy fleet readiness.To sum up, C3.ai’s technological edge and alliances place it well within the global AI ecosystem, but partnerships alone cannot compensate for weak execution. To regain its stride, the company must translate its high-profile collaborations into consistent and scalable performance, which will then determine whether its platform can truly power the next wave of enterprise AI adoption. Firms likePalantir Technologies Inc.PLTR andSnowflake Inc.SNOW offer substantial competition to C3.ai across the enterprise AI or AI-solutions market.Palantir leverages its strong government and commercial partnerships to expand its Foundry and Gotham platforms, emphasizing integrated data analytics and operational decision-making. Snowflake, on the other hand, continues to scale its Data Cloud ecosystem, embedding AI and machine learning tools to make data insights more accessible and automated.Compared with Palantir and Snowflake, C3.ai’s model is more vertically specialized, aiming to accelerate digital transformation through pre-built AI solutions. However, Palantir’s established contracts and Snowflake’s broad enterprise adoption give them scale advantages. Thus, as the market consolidates around data-driven AI integration, C3.ai must strengthen its ecosystem and monetization pace to sustain competitive momentum against Palantir and Snowflake. Shares of this AI software provider have gained 22.9% in the past month, outperforming the Zacks Computers - IT Services industry, the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 index, as evidenced by the chart below.

CrowdStrike also expanded Falcon Privileged Access, making it easier to handle complex Active Directory and MicrosoftEntraID setups. The tool is focused on automating access grants and revocations through Microsoft Teams and Falcon Fusion SOAR. This is aimed at reducing standing privileges while also lowering risk. Another addition includes identity-driven case management, which aims to link related detections into a single case inside Falcon’s Next-Generation SIEM. The feature combines endpoint, cloud, and SaaS telemetry, giving security teams full context to investigate and respond faster. Identity security is one of CrowdStrike’s fastest-growing areas. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, CrowdStrike’s identity business reached $435 million in ARR, up 21% year over year. With these newer updates, CrowdStrike is aiming to pull customers away from legacy IAM and PAM tools to drive higher adoption of its platform. If this strategy becomes successful, Identity Security could help CrowdStrike to move closer to its long-term target of $10 billion in ARR by fiscal 2031. CyberArk(CYBR) andOkta Inc.(OKTA) are key players competing with CrowdStrike in identity security. CyberArk is an established leader in identity security and privileged access management. CyberArk is rapidly enhancing the capabilities of its identity security platform with AI integration. CyberArk Secure AI Agents Solution and CORA AI are the two most important recent additions to its portfolio, enabling it to secure a full spectrum of identities, including human, AI and machine. Okta is best known for its identity and access management solutions. Okta has been adding AI-driven tools that automate risk detection and reduce manual processes in managing user access. Enterprises can implement Identity Threat Protection with Okta AI to leverage AI and machine learning techniques for real-time detection of the entire spectrum of Identity attacks. Shares of CrowdStrike have gained 45.1% year to date compared with the Security industry’s growth of 21.1%.

MSFT,Will Monolith AI Buyout Boost CoreWeave's Industrial Cloud Strategy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/monolith-ai-buyout-boost-coreweaves-144200426.html,2025-10-08,"In a major move to strengthen its position in the global AI infrastructure market,CoreWeave, Inc.(CRWV) has signed an agreement to acquire Monolith AI Limited, known for applying AI and machine learning to solve complex physics and engineering problems. This move not only creates buyout synergies for CRWV but also for users, as it aims to develop a comprehensive AI platform that helps enterprises significantly reduce R&D cycles, speed up product design, and reach new levels of efficiency and innovation. By integrating Monolith’s simulation and test-based machine learning with CoreWeave’s specialized AI cloud, the combined organization is positioned to offer a comprehensive AI platform tailored for industrial and manufacturing firms. It aims to foster a seamless AI-enabled environment where engineers can utilize advanced AI tools directly within their workflows. The synergy of Monolith’s software strengths and CRWV’s infrastructure enables enterprises to speed up innovation and shorten time-to-market, which is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge. For CRWV, the acquisition builds on its previous strategic moves, including the acquisition of OpenPipe (focused on reinforcement learning) and Weights & Biases, a leading platform for model iteration and experiment tracking. Additionally, acquiring Core Scientific Inc. is likely to expand CRWV’s infrastructure footprint and lower lease obligations, boosting operational efficiency and financial flexibility. Furthermore, Monolithic positions CoreWeave to expand its AI capabilities into mainstream automotive design and manufacturing, enabling faster, smarter, and more efficient vehicle development. Other industrial sectors, such as Aerospace, are also expected to leverage the combined platform to accelerate R&D and innovation. However, frequent acquisitions increase integration risks. It already has a debt-heavy balance sheet and has raised $25 billion in debt and equity since 2024 to support capacity expansion amid surging demand for AI computing. While the capital raise allows CRWV to accelerate data center investments and meet growing AI demand, it also adds financial pressure. CoreWeave’s fierce competitor,Nebius Group N.V. (NBIS), is dedicated to building a focused AI infrastructure business. It is quickly expanding in the AI infrastructure sector, aiming to reach 1 GW capacity by 2026. The company signed a five-year agreement with Microsoft to supply GPU capacity, valued at $17.4 billion through 2031, with the potential to increase to $19.4 billion if Microsoft boosts its demand. Unlike CoreWeave, it has grown organically, developing AI ventures such as Toloka (data labeling), TripleTen (tech education), and Avride (autonomous driving). Nebius raised its guidance for annualized run rate (ARR) revenues from the previous range of $750 million to $1 billion to the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. On the other hand,Microsoft(MSFT), a tech behemoth, is capitalizing on AI business momentum fueled by strong Copilot adoption and the rapid expansion of its Azure cloud infrastructure. In September, it pledged a $30 billion investment in UK AI and cloud infrastructure through 2028, including $15 billion in capital spend, to build its largest AI infrastructure, boost operations, and strengthen U.K.-U.S. tech ties. As highlighted byTracxnin September 2025, Microsoft has made 211 acquisitions across 96 sectors and 23 countries, including 138 in the United States. Key areas include cybersecurity, gaming, and enterprise collaboration. Its latest deal was the March 2024 acquisition of Inflection, a Palo Alto-based AI model developer for businesses. Shares of CoreWeave have gained 206.9% in the past six months compared with the Internet Software industry’s growth of 42.7%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In terms of Price/Book, CRWV shares are trading at 24.61X, way higher than the industry’s 6.53X.

MSFT,A Dave Ramsey Caller Paid Off Their House Exactly As He Preaches. But They Admit They Don't Feel 'The Sense Of Freedom' They Were Promised,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dave-ramsey-caller-paid-off-140037435.html,2025-10-08,"Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Brittany from Indiana called into “The Ramsey Show” with what sounded like a dream scenario. She and her husband hadpaid off their homein 2023, wiped out all debt, and were followingDave Ramsey's “Baby Steps” exactly as he teaches. But when Brittany spoke, she admitted they weren't feeling the payoff they expected. “We don't feel the sense of freedom, I guess, that we kind of expected or wanted,” Brittany told Ramsey and co-hostJohn Delony. “We're currently saving for a big home renovation. Our house was built in the 70s and a lot of the original exterior components are in need of being replaced.” In other words, they're trying to balance enjoying freedom with staying intense so that they can get the renovations done and then really feel free. Don't Miss: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*,which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. $100k+ in investable assets?Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes– no cost, no obligation. Ramsey responded with a dose of perspective. “It is devastating that no matter what stage of money you get at, you find out it's finite,” he said. “Contentment is kind of a bully in the schoolyard. It says, ‘Step across this line and I'll punch you.’ You step across the line, it backs up and draws another line. It’s a moving target.” He explained that Brittany'sfeelings are common, even for people who become millionaires. “Intellectually, you didn't think it was going to be unlimited, but emotionally you felt like you were going to feel like you were unlimited.” Delony added that it’s like thinking you’re a millionaire, so you don't have to budget anymore. Trending: Backed by $300M+ in Assets and Microsoft's Climate Fund,Farmland LP Opens Vital Farmland III to Accredited Investors Delony pushed Brittany to reframe how she looked at her situation. “Here's my promise to you. The day these renovations are over, if you and your husband don't get together ASAP and change how you experience the world, you're going to find yourself in yet another self-created prison,” he said. “You are choosing to live in an old house, which means you are choosing to update this stuff. Some stuff has to be done, some stuff doesn't. These are all choices. You're not owned by it.” Ramsey also pointed out the difference between financial freedom and financial catastrophe. “Thank God you don’t have this window project and a house payment,” he said. “Thank God it’s an inconvenience versus a freaking catastrophe. When your life’s broke, your life looks like a country song. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong.” See Also:In terms of getting money back,these bank accounts put traditional checking and savings accounts to shame. Ramsey used his own life as an example, describing a time when he finally realized he didn’t need to buy anything to feel satisfied. “Godliness with contentment is great gain,” he said. “I became convinced that contentment might be the most powerful financial principle. If you don’t have contentment, you get into debt. If you do have contentment, you can save.” For Brittany and her husband, Ramsey and Delony agreed the challenge wasn’t financial mismanagement but learning to breathe and see their progress for what it is: true freedom. “You’re in control. You’re making a choice,” Ramsey reminded her. “The great news is you have choices.” Read Next: Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes:Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey – no cost, no obligation.
