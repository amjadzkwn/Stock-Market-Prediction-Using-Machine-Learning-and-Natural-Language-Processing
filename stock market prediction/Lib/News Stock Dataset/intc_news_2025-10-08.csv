INTC,What's driving the latest bout of AI deals? Analyst answers.,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-driving-latest-bout-ai-213000938.html,2025-10-08,"Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Futurum CEO Daniel Newman discuss the AI milestones that could push Big Tech companies and hyperscalers even farther, includingmeeting compute capacity and demands, amid the latest round ofartificial intelligence deals and partnerships. Also catch Daniel Newman and Patrick Moorhead weigh in onwhether bubbles are forming in the AI trade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat? Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them. I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility. On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this. I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value. What do you make of that, Dan? These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future. They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future. The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future. And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out. The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold. So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend. But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."
INTC,AMD CEO Lisa Su says AI critics are 'thinking too small' after massive OpenAI deal,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-ceo-lisa-su-says-ai-critics-are-thinking-too-small-after-massive-openai-deal-202818700.html,2025-10-08,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su says it's time for the tech world to think bigger about artificial intelligence. ""I would say that's probably thinking too small,"" Su told Yahoo Finance on Monday when asked about concerns that massive AI investments may be getting ahead of themselves. ""You have to really look at what the power of this technology can do for the world."" Su said the company is ""investing at the right pace because we want to accelerate ... this is a place where [and] when companies and partners make bold moves, it will be rewarded."" Shares of AMD rose 4% before the bell on Tuesday, having jumped by as much as 35% on Monday after the companyannounceda multibillion-dollar partnership with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. It's one of the largest infrastructure deals to date. It will see AMD supply up to 6 gigawatts of GPUs to the ChatGPT maker over several years, starting with its upcoming MI450 chips in the second half of 2026. Under the agreement, AMD also issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company. Shares will vest in stages as AMD hits milestones, beginning once the company deploys its first 1 gigawatt of chips. Su said the deal could generate ""tens of billions of dollars"" in revenue for AMD over the next few years. Additionally, the agreement culminates years-long discussions with OpenAI. The news comes on the heels of Nvidia's (NVDA) own $100 billion bet on OpenAI, underscoring the escalating race to build out AI infrastructure. Nvidia has also announced a $5 billion investment in Intel (INTC) to co-develop data centers and PC products. AMD has spent the past two years trying to chip away at Nvidia's AI GPU dominance. Nvidia commands roughly90% of the market. Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about AMD's OpenAI deal. Barclays analyst Tom O'Malley said the structure — which includes stock warrants triggered by milestones and a $600 share price target — ""is designed to be mutually beneficial,"" but is also aimed at ""driving the stock higher."" He estimates the deal could add $18 billion in annual revenue and $3 per share in quarterly earnings per share by 2030 if deployment progresses as expected. Citi analyst Atif Malik noted the announcement also benefits other AI ecosystem players, including Astera Labs (ALAB), which supplies networking infrastructure tied to AMD's new Helios platform. ""We see the news positively for ALAB as it is a leader in open AI networking ecosystems,"" Malik wrote, calling Helios a ""key catalyst"" for the broader AI hardware landscape. Looking ahead, Su said the AI boom is still in its early innings. ""I really believe that this is the beginning of a 10-year kind of supercycle,"" she said, adding that the potential for AI to transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research, is only starting to unfold. ""We believe with the proper use of AI compute, you can solve diseases faster. You can do much faster drug discovery. You can do much better in terms of diagnosing issues that people have early on and that makes ... a personal difference in people's lives,"" she said.

INTC,"Intel to reveal tech details on forthcoming PC chip, sources say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-reveal-tech-details-forthcoming-225159709.html,2025-10-08,"By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel (INTC) plans to release technical details about its forthcoming chip for laptops, known as Panther Lake, on Thursday, four sources briefed on the plans told Reuters. It is part of an effort to reassure investors about Intel's first product made entirely using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A, the sources said. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. The Panther Lake chips are the company's high-end mobile processors that are typically included in more expensive laptops and are the first high-volume Intel products to use the 18A process that the company has spent billions developing. In part because of manufacturing stumbles, Intel has steadily ceded laptop and PC market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices. Panther Lake represents an opportunity to reverse some of the losses. The company conducted hours of technical briefings and factory tours in Arizona for industry analysts last week on the new Panther Lake microarchitecture, including detailed explanations of the graphics and central processor cores and its media engine, according to the sources. Intel revealed a redesigned AI engine and the company's efficiency and performance processor cores, which were redesigned for the 18A manufacturing process. The last-generation laptop chip called Lunar Lake was primarily made by Intel rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel executives have said the Panther Lake chips will be available early in 2026, according to the sources. The new chips use 30% less energy than the prior generation, and its graphics and central processors will receive a 50% boost in their ability to crunch data in some situations, according to a second source briefed on the chips. The technical briefings conducted last week for a group of analysts and journalists underscored the importance of Panther Lake's success to Intel, which has struggled to manufacture the cutting-edge chips. An Intel spokesperson said the company holds technical briefings in the autumn most years on various topics but declined to comment further. In July, the chipmaker reported a second-quarter loss of $2.9 billion and disclosed that if it did not secure a customer for its planned future 14A manufacturing process, it would suspend work on it. After U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpcalled for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in August, Intel attracted investments from SoftBank Group andNvidia. After Tan met with Trump and other officials in the White House, the administration worked out a deal to transform a CHIPS Act grant into a 9.9% equity stake in the company. Last week, as part of the briefings, Intel conducted a tour for reporters and industry analysts of its factories in Arizona, including one called Fab 52, the people said. Intel broke ground on Fab 52 in 2021 as part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's multibillion-dollar global expansion plan to compete with TSMC in the contract manufacturing business. Fab 52 houses Intel's 18A in-house manufacturing process, which includes a new transistor design and a method of delivering energy to the chip more efficiently. The tour aimed to demonstrate Intel's manufacturing prowess and show off the chip factory, or fab, that it will use for high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake chips. Reuters did not attend this tour. Intel executives did not discuss the current Panther Lake yields, or the number of good chips that Intel is capable of producing, according to the people. Reuters reported in August that over the summer the Panther Lake yield was roughly 10%, up from 5% late last year. (Reporting by Max A. Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

INTC,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Intel, AMD and NVIDIA",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zacks-analyst-blog-highlights-intel-131600024.html,2025-10-08,"Chicago, IL – October 7, 2025 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Intel Corp. INTC, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA. Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: Intel Corp.has surged 88.2% in the past six months compared with the industry's growth of 87.6%. It has, however, lagged its peers,Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.andNVIDIA Corp.. Advance Micro has gained 96.8%, while NVIDIA has soared 92.1% over the same period. With the appointment of David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim Co-CEOs, replacing former CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel is undertaking a comprehensive review of its businesses to put the company back on its growth trajectory. Interim management has vouched to keep the core strategy unchanged despite efforts to drive operational efficiency and agility. The company is emphasizing the diligent execution of operational goals to establish itself as a leading foundry. Intel is witnessing healthy traction in Artificial Intelligence (AI) PCs that have taken the market by storm. It remains firmly on track to ship more than 100 million by the end of 2025. Panther Lake — the chip based on Intel 18A and the architectural successor to the well-received Lunar Lake – is slated to be launched this month, while Clearwater Forest — the first Intel 18A server product — is likely to be unveiled in the first half of 2026. The company has introduced Intel Core Ultra, which features a neural processing unit that enables power-efficient AI acceleration with 2.5x better power efficiency than the previous generation. With superior GPU and CPU capabilities, it can speed up AI solutions. The company also launched the new vPro platform with an Intel Core Ultra processor that delivers enhanced power efficiency. With dedicated AI acceleration capability spread across the CPU, GPU and the new neural processing unit, it will unlock an endless new wave of AI experiences across all apps. This is likely to give healthy competition to NVIDIA and Advanced Micro's new GPU lineups for PC gaming. Intel has secured a $5 billion investment from NVIDIA to jointly develop cutting-edge solutions that are likely to play an integral role in the evolution of the AI infrastructure ecosystem. Leveraging the core strengths of both firms, namely NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing and Intel's CPU technologies and x86 ecosystem, the collaboration is expected to sow the seeds of innovation through the development of state-of-the-art custom data center and PC products. In August 2025, Softbank invested $2 billion in Intel to propel AI research and development initiatives that support digital transformation, cloud computing and next-generation infrastructure. The investment enabled Softbank to gain about 2% ownership in Intel, with the former paying $23 per share. This followed $7.86 billion in direct funding from the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act to advance critical semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging projects in Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio and Oregon. The significant capital infusions will enable Intel to expand its manufacturing capacity to accelerate its IDM 2.0 (Integrated Device Manufacturing) strategy. Despite the uptrend, it appears that Intel has a lot of work to do to catch up with its rivals. While most competitors evolved with changing demand patterns, Intel fell behind others as it clung to its legacy products. For example, despite making significant inroads in AI chips, Intel lagged NVIDIA on the innovation front with the latter's H100 and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) being runaway successes. This offered a competitive advantage to NVIDIA, with leading technology companies reportedly piling up NVIDIA's GPUs to build clusters of computers for their AI work. Moreover, Intel has been facing challenges due to the disruptive rise of over-the-top service providers in this dynamic industry. This has affected its margins. Price-sensitive competition for customer retention in the core business is expected to intensify in the coming days. An accelerated ramp-up of AI PCs has significantly affected Intel's short-term margins, as it shifted production to its high-volume facility in Ireland, where wafer costs are typically higher. Margins were also adversely impacted by higher charges related to non-core businesses, charges associated with unused capacity and an unfavorable product mix. Competitive pricing pressure from rivals has further dented its profitability. China accounted for more than 29% of Intel's total revenues in 2024, making it the single largest market for the company. However, the communist nation's purported move to replace U.S.-made chips with domestic alternatives significantly affected INTC's revenue prospects. The directive to phase out foreign chips from key telecom networks by 2027 underscores Beijing's accelerating efforts to reduce reliance on Western technology amid escalating U.S.-China trade and tariff tensions. As Washington tightens restrictions on high-tech exports to China, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for Intel, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers. In addition, weaker spending across consumer and enterprise markets, especially in China, resulted in elevated customer inventory levels. Earnings estimates for Intel for 2025 have moved down 86.9% to 14 cents over the past year, while those for 2026 have declined 63.2% to 67 cents. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock. Intel's innovative AI solutions hold immense promise for the broader semiconductor ecosystem. By addressing the challenges of scalability, performance and interoperability, it is paving the way for widespread AI adoption across enterprises worldwide. Management is focusing on simplifying parts of its portfolio to unlock efficiencies and create value. Significant capital infusion to revive its lost glory is likely to spur growth. All these efforts appear to resonate well, as exhibited by an uptrend in the stock price performance. However, the recent product launches appear ""too little too late"" for Intel. In addition, margin woes amid strict export restrictions, unfavorable product mix and elevated customer inventory levels weigh on its bottom line. Declining earnings estimates remain an overhang. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Intel appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they exercise caution and stay invested for long-term gains.

The market is currently buzzing about technologies where Super Micro Computer plays a key role, and there is a widespread belief that underlying trends could keep driving growth forward. Still, just because a stock is a market darling does not mean it is undervalued out of habit. In fact, by objectively scoring the company's valuation, Super Micro Computer clocks in at just 1 out of 6 possible undervalued checks. This means plenty of investors are paying up for its promise. So, how does this all translate into whether Super Micro Computer is actually a bargain or riding a wave of optimism? In the sections ahead, we will break down what different valuation models have to say and hint at a more insightful way to size up the stock’s true worth that most investors overlook. Super Micro Computer scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in thefull valuation breakdown. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model projects a company’s expected future cash flows and then discounts them back to today’s dollars to estimate what the business is worth now. This approach focuses on a company's ability to generate cash over the long term. For Super Micro Computer, the current Free Cash Flow (FCF) stands at approximately $1.52 billion. Looking ahead, analysts provide firm estimates for the next five years, while Simply Wall St extrapolates the company’s FCF further into the future. By 2035, FCF is expected to be around $378.86 million, indicating a notable decline from the current high. Such projections suggest lower growth optimism in the later years. After running the numbers through a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model, the calculated fair value of the stock is just $8.82 per share. With the share price significantly above this level, the DCF implies that Super Micro Computer is trading at a 519.1% premium to its estimated intrinsic worth. This method suggests the stock is highly overvalued.

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Super Micro Computer may be overvalued by 519.1%.Find undervalued stocksorcreate your own screenerto find better value opportunities. For profitable companies, the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a well-established tool to gauge whether a stock is trading at a reasonable price relative to its earnings power. It is especially useful for mature businesses because it captures both how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of profit and, indirectly, their views on future growth and risk. The ""right"" PE ratio for a stock depends on how quickly earnings are expected to grow, how stable or risky those earnings might be, and how the company stacks up against peers. Rapidly growing or more resilient companies tend to command a higher multiple. Riskier or slower-growing firms usually get discounted. Currently, Super Micro Computer trades at a PE ratio of 30.95x. To put that in context, the average for its Tech industry peers is 24.00x. The broader peer group sits at 21.49x. Based solely on these numbers, the stock looks pricier than most rivals. However, Simply Wall St’s proprietary ""Fair Ratio"" provides a more tailored benchmark. The Fair Ratio, which in this case is 61.73x, adjusts for unique factors including Super Micro Computer’s earnings growth prospects, profit margins, industry dynamics, market cap, and risk profile. This approach goes beyond the basic comparisons by recognizing why one company might warrant a significantly different multiple than another, even within the same sector. Since Super Micro Computer’s current PE (30.95x) is well below its Fair Ratio (61.73x), the stock appears clearly undervalued according to this methodology. Result: UNDERVALUED PE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere?Discover companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth. Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. A Narrative is your own financial story for a company, a way to connect what you believe about its future (like revenue growth, profit margins, and fair value) with the numbers, giving your investment decision context beyond just ratios or analyst targets. Narratives link the company’s story and your perspective directly to financial forecasts and fair value, making it easy to see how your expectations would affect your buy or sell decision. Available on Simply Wall St’s Community page, Narratives are simple and accessible for anyone, helping millions of investors compare their fair value to the current market price. They update automatically as new information or earnings are released, so your thesis is always relevant. For example, some Super Micro Computer Narratives in the Community see a fair value as high as $74.7, assuming robust long-term AI growth, while others land as low as $15, factoring in governance worries or slower expansion. Narratives empower you to visualize, challenge, and refine your investment view, putting you in control with dynamic, data-connected tools uniquely tailored to your outlook on the stock. For Super Micro Computer, we will make it very easy for you with previews of two leading Super Micro Computer Narratives: 🐂 Super Micro Computer Bull Case Fair Value: $74.53 Discount to current price: -26.7% Revenue Growth Assumption: 50% Management is guiding for substantial revenue growth, targeting $23 to $25 billion in 2025 and $40 billion by 2026, driven by Direct Liquid Cooling adoption in new data centers. The company recovered strongly after former accounting challenges, is releasing restated filings, and continues to forge key partnerships with major players like NVIDIA, AMD, xAI, and Intel. Applying a 50% growth rate, current margins, and a forward PE of 20, the narrative estimates a fair value significantly above today's share price, reflecting high conviction in SMCI's role as an essential AI infrastructure provider. 🐻 Super Micro Computer Bear Case Fair Value: $50.06 Premium to current price: 9.1% Revenue Growth Assumption: 29.9% Ongoing global AI and analytics demand will drive revenue growth, but margin and earnings stability are challenged by customer concentration, hardware commoditization, and execution risks in scaling new solutions. Consensus analyst models anticipate Super Micro’s profit margins increasing only modestly, with future revenues and earnings supporting a fair value close to $50, and price growth paced largely by expanded, but competitive, data center deployments. The company’s reliance on a few large customers, elongated purchasing cycles, and intense sector competition present significant risks that could lead to earnings volatility, margin compression, and reduced valuation upside compared to current market optimism.

INTC,"Trilogy Metals is latest in Trump's U.S. investment spree, stocks soars",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trilogy-metals-latest-white-house-120350546.html,2025-10-08,"Minerals exploration company Trilogy Metals’ shares soared more than 200% in premarket trading after the White House said it would take a 10% stake in the company, marking the latest investment in a private company by the U.S. government. The federal governmentsaidit is going into a partnership with Trilogy, which has mining claims in Alaska. It is part of a push to unlock supplies of copper and other critical minerals in the Ambler mining district, in the remote northeast of the state. Its $35.6 million investment gives the U.S. a one-tenth stake in the Canadian company, which is listed in America, while the deal gives it the right to buy an additional 7.5% of its stock. Trilogy stock soared 230% in Tuesday morning trading. The move comes on the heels of the Trump administration taking holdings in the struggling semiconductor giantInteland the rare earth company MP Materials. Washington also took a “golden share” in United States Steel as a condition of the company’s sale to Japanese firm Nippon Steel. And last week, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the U.S. would take a stake in Lithium Americas, another Canadian firm, in a bid to secure ""our nation's access to the largest confirmed lithium deposit in North America."" The White House has portrayedthe strategyas a boost for taxpayers, and pointed to Trump’s alleged skills in striking deals. But critics have raised concerns that the trend could undermine the strength of the free market. The investment, and accompanying decision to give the green light to the Ambler Road Project – which gives access to the mining district – overturns the Biden administration’s move to block the same project last year. The area has “one of the largest undeveloped copper-zinc mineral belts in the world and contains extensive deposits of copper, silver, gold, lead, cobalt, and other strategic metals,” it said. The administration claimed there is a “need for access to domestic critical minerals, and there is no economically feasible and prudent alternative route.” Opponents to the project have said the 211-mile Ambler Road project have said it will harm landscapes that support local communities and wildlife. The company said the order “reflects a renewed federal commitment to responsible resource development in Alaska and highlights the Ambler Road as critical infrastructure under federal policy.”"
INTC,Is Nvidia Stock a Buy After AI Partnerships with Intel and OpenAI?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-buy-ai-partnerships-111500449.html,2025-10-08,"Nvidia jumped from simply selling AI chips to taking on transformative deals with Intel and OpenAI. The company sees the need for rapid expansion of AI infrastructure. Nvidia’s revenue remains strong in the face of challenges, such as being barred from sales to China. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia › Shares of semiconductor chip leaderNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)have been riding a rocket ship, particularly after the astounding announcements of investments inIntelandChatGPT creatorOpenAI. The stock is up about 40% this year. The deals demonstrate Nvidia's expansion beyond merely selling AI products. The company is taking a larger role in driving changes to thecloud computingmarket, where artificial intelligence systems are housed. These partnerships mark a new chapter in the company's storied history. Does this mean now is the time to scoop up Nvidia shares? Let's dive into the implications of these deals to find out. In September, Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in Intel. The AI leader's decision to partner with the ailing semiconductor giant was an interesting choice. The once-dominant Intel has struggled for years as it missed the boat on mobile device technology and, more recently, AI. These issues are reflected in its stock's price-to-book (P/B) ratio, which plunged to a multi-year low last year. But Nvidia stands to gain in more far-reaching ways beyond capitalizing on Intel's low valuation. As a fabless semiconductor company, Nvidia outsources the manufacturing of its cutting-edge AI chips. It plans to leverage Intel's manufacturing facilities to build AI products for data centers and PCs, but that's just one benefit of the deal. In describing the partnership, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, ""Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing."" That era involves AI factories. For some time, Huang predicted the arrival of a new industrial revolution, one requiring AI factories where the output is intelligence. These factories are data centers designed to support the level of computing power needed for AI. But many of today's data centers are not up to the task. This is where Nvidia's deals with Intel and OpenAI come in. The trio will work together to fill this gap. One example of AI factories coming to pass is the British government's goal to expand the country's AI computing infrastructure by 20 times over the next five years. To that end, the U.K. partnered with OpenAI, and in turn, OpenAI enlisted Nvidia to provide as much as 31,000 AI chips. On top of that, Nvidia announced a separate deal with OpenAI that's much larger and far reaching. The semiconductor titan will invest $100 billion in OpenAI. In return, OpenAI commits to using Nvidia products to build out the massive AI infrastructure needed to advance its artificial intelligence models. This requires a staggering number of Nvidia's AI chips, estimated to stretch into the millions. The collaborations with OpenAI and Intel suggest spectacular sales growth ahead for Nvidia, even though it faces geopolitical hurdles to selling AI chips to China, one of the largest AI markets in the world. In April, the Trump administration implemented requirements that hurt Nvidia's China sales. Then in September, Chinese businesses were banned from buying Nvidia products by their government. Despite the challenges, Nvidia's revenue continues to climb. In its fiscal second quarter, ended July 27, sales increased 56% year over year to $46.7 billion. In fiscal Q3, the company forecasted revenue to accelerate to $54 billion, and that's accounting for a lack of sales to China. Nvidia's outsized success, combined with news of its Intel and OpenAI collaborations, helped to propel its stock to an all-time high of $191.05 on Oct. 2. The achievement raises the question whether now is the time to buy shares. To evaluate its share price valuation, here's a comparison of Nvidia stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio against that of longtime semiconductor chip rivalAdvanced Micro Devices. Although AMD's P/E ratio is lower than it was a year ago, Nvidia's remains lower. This indicates Nvidia stock is the better value. That said, an earnings multiple hovering around 54 is not cheap. An argument can be made that Nvidia stock is worth the premium. The company holds a commanding position in the AI chip industry, controlling an estimated 94% market share. This dominance, combined with strategic partnerships with Intel and OpenAI to meet the increasing demand for AI computing power, make Nvidia a worthwhile investment for the long term. But after the stock hit an all-time high, it's ideal to wait for shares to pull back a bit before deciding to buy.

INTC,AMD Stock Erupts After Pre-FOMC OpenAI Deal: Is There a Computing Power War Coming For Crypto?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-stock-erupts-pre-fomc-100250244.html,2025-10-08,"OpenAI has inked a multiyear deal with AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) for six gigawatts of GPU capacity to power its next generation of AI models. It’s a mic drop moment. The agreement, unveiled Monday, could deliver tens of billions in revenue over five years, marking AMD’s biggest step yet toward challenging Nvidia’s dominance in AI chips. AMD and Nvidia will never become the same. NVIDIA will likely make anx86 processorthat might be ok, but AMD is crushing in CPUs and might forever after this deal. Intel will eventually be sold off to government mothballs since they can’t make new enterprise or consumer products. AMD shares jumped +35% at the open, trading near $204, as investors priced in the deal’s long-term significance. The agreement grantsOpenAIup to 160 million share warrants, roughly 10% of AMD’s equity, if certain rollout milestones are met, according to filings. Here’s what to know if you want to know whether to invest or wait: DISCOVER:20+ Next Crypto to Explode in 2025 AMD just gave OpenAI 160M shares for pennies so they can sell it off and give it back to AMD in exchange for their GPUs. We’re reaching levels of financial finesse that get you executed in places like China. The deal instantly rippled across markets. The S&P 500 climbed to 6,740.28 and the Nasdaq Composite surged to 22,941.67, both notching fresh record closes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped slightly, dragged by weakness in consumer data. This was another chapter in the 2025 AI melt-up. Strategist Ed Yardeni raised his year-end S&P target to 7,000, calling it a “slow-motion melt-up,” while Evercore ISI’s Julian Emanuel maintained a bullish 7,750 projection for 2026. Nvidia fell just over 1%, but few on Wall Street expect the company’s decade-long dominance to disappear overnight. Instead, analysts see AMD emerging as the critical second supplier for the global AI ecosystem. DISCOVER:Next 1000X Crypto: 10+ Crypto Tokens That Can Hit 1000x in 2025 According to FRED data, semiconductor manufacturing output in the United States rose +18.6% year-over-year as of Q3 2025, driven almost entirely by AI chip demand. Moreover, DeFi Llama notes that blockchain-based cloud computing projects like Render and Akash Network have seen a +30% TVL surge in the same period, reflecting that decentralized compute alternatives are surging with the AI race. The AMD deal comes just one week after OpenAI signed separate agreements with Samsung and SK Hynix to secure high-bandwidth memory chips, and a month after Oracle’s +35% stock jump on news of a new AI server contract with OpenAI. Combined, the moves signal a deliberate strategy to diversify beyond Nvidia. “OpenAI’s move to balance supply between AMD, Nvidia, and Asian partners is smart risk management,” said a semiconductor strategist at Baird. , which has recently behaved as a liquidity gauge for tech speculation, is holding above $124,000, while gold is near $3,900, suggesting traders are hedging both ends of inflation.

INTC,Global Glass Substrates for Semiconductors Market Report 2026-2036: Technical and Economic Hurdles Amid Strategic Opportunities Through Quantum-Neuromorphic-Edge Convergence,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-glass-substrates-semiconductors-market-094500137.html,2025-10-08,"The glass substrate for semiconductors market is revolutionizing the packaging industry due to the growing demands of AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and advanced networking. This market transition is shifting glass from a background material to a core substrate, supporting next-gen chip architectures. Recent speculation about notable industry partnerships—such as SKC's potential collaboration with major AI chip manufacturers, which boosted its stock by 44.4% in 2025—demonstrates increasing investor confidence. Serving AI accelerators and HPC, glass substrates ensure optimal bandwidth density and power delivery, offering superior thermal matching, low transmission losses, and robustness against heat and warpage. Critical for advanced packaging transitions, major semiconductor players like Intel, AMD, and Broadcom are planning adoption. Dublin, Oct. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The""The Global Market for Glass Substrates for Semiconductors 2026-2036""report has been added toResearchAndMarkets.com'soffering.TheGlobal Glass Substrate for Semiconductors Market 2026-2036report provides critical insights for semiconductor manufacturers, substrate suppliers, equipment providers, and technology investors navigating this revolutionary transition. The report delivers comprehensive coverage across seven critical application segments: carrier and support glass, blank drilled core panels, finished IC substrates for single-die usage, finished interposers for multi-die packages, glass integrated passive devices (IPD), RF-MEMS applications, and photonic integration tiles. Each segment analysis includes detailed market forecasts, technology requirements, competitive positioning, and growth drivers specific to AI accelerators, data center infrastructure, 5G/6G communications, automotive electronics, and consumer devices. The glass substrate for semiconductors market represents one of the most significant material shifts in the packaging industry in decades, driven by the escalating demands of AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and advanced networking applications. This emerging market is transitioning glass from a background consumable to the core substrate material enabling next-generation chip architectures. The market is experiencing unexpected acceleration, with commercialization timelines moving ahead of initial projections. Recent industry events have highlighted the competitive intensity, particularly following speculation about potential partnerships between major players. SKC's stock price surged 44.4% in early 2025 after comments suggesting advanced negotiations with leading AI chip manufacturers, signaling investor confidence in near-term commercialization prospects. The momentum reflects growing recognition that glass substrates can deliver up to 40% speed improvements while reducing power consumption by half compared to conventional organic substrates. The surge in AI accelerators and HPC devices has created unprecedented demands for bandwidth density and power delivery that traditional organic substrates simply cannot support. Modern training accelerators require thousands of high-speed I/O bumps and power-delivery networks handling hundreds of amps with minimal noise. Glass substrates address these challenges through superior dimensional stability, ultra-low warpage, and the ability to support sub-2-micron interconnects with exceptional signal integrity. Glass substrates excel in heat and warpage resistance while enabling higher chip stacking densities on single substrates. The smoother surface allows ultra-fine circuit patterns, making them ideal for applications spanning carrier glass, IC substrates, interposers for multi-die packages, RF-MEMS applications, and photonic integration. Major semiconductor companies including Intel, AMD, and Broadcom have announced adoption plans for their next-generation chips. Glass substrates offer compelling advantages over existing materials. Their coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) matches silicon (3-7 ppm/C), dramatically reducing thermomechanical stress in advanced packages. The dielectric constant is significantly lower than silicon (2.8 vs. 12), enabling superior high-frequency performance with orders of magnitude lower transmission losses. Manufacturing infrastructure is rapidly developing. Through-glass via (TGV) formation represents the core enabling technology, with multiple approaches including laser-induced deep etching (LIDE), direct laser drilling, and photosensitive glass processing. Leading equipment suppliers like LPKF, Canon, and Yield Engineering Systems are developing production-ready tools. The glass substrate market emergence coincides with the industry's shift toward advanced packaging methodologies including chiplets, 2.5D/3D-IC integration, and heterogeneous system architectures. While organic substrates will continue serving mainstream applications, the accelerating timeline for glass commercialization suggests the high-performance segment transition may occur faster than initially anticipated. Success depends on continued yield improvements, cost reduction through scale, and ecosystem maturation. With AI/HPC growth driving performance requirements beyond organic substrate capabilities, glass substrates represent the critical enabler for continued semiconductor advancement, with commercial deployment potentially beginning as early as 2025-2026.

INTC,"Trending tickers: AppLovin, AMD, B&M, Shell",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-tickers-applovin-amd-bm-shell-091344556.html,2025-10-08,"Shares in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rallied 23.7% on Monday, pushing higher after news emerged that the chipmaker has struck a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI. The move will see AMD (AMD) supply up to 6 gigawatts of graphics processing units (GPUs) to the ChatGPT maker over several years, starting with its upcoming MI450 chips in the second half of 2026. Under the agreement, AMD (AMD) also issued OpenAI warrants for up to 160 million shares, or roughly 10% of the company. Shares will vest in stages as AMD hits milestones, beginning once the company deploys its first 1 gigawatt of chips. AMD CEO Lisa Su said the deal could generate ""tens of billions of dollars"" in revenue for AMD over the next few years. Additionally, the agreement culminates years-long discussions with OpenAI. The news comes on the heels of Nvidia's (NVDA) own $100bn (£74bn) bet on OpenAI, underscoring the escalating race to build out AI infrastructure. Nvidia has also announced a $5bn investment in Intel (INTC) to co-develop data centres and PC products.

INTC,AMD-OpenAI deal is helping build 'foundation' of the AI world: CEO,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-openai-deal-helping-build-193159548.html,2025-10-08,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announcedan AI chip deal with OpenAI(OPAI.PVT) on Monday, sending the semiconductor stock soaring; this deal also has OpenAI taking up a 10% stake in AMD. This all comes after Nvidia (NVDA) inkeda $100 billion investment into OpenAIwhile also brokering partnerships withIntel(INTC) andAlibaba(BABA). AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su sits down with Yahoo Finance executive editorBrian Sozzito discuss the company's OpenAI partnership, the chipmaker's role in building out AI infrastructure and empowering large-language models (LLMs), and investing back into the AI ecosystem. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. It's always good to see you. Uh, you never cease to amaze me on these deals you strike and and what you've been doing here at AMD since you joined many years ago. Uh, congrats on this news. For investors not familiar with precisely what you announced. I'm taking it as OpenAI, AMD are working together to build the future of AI infrastructure. How do you see it? Yeah, well, first of all, Brian, it's great to be here, uh, with you. And yes, uh, today is a a big moment for us. Uh, very exciting deal. You know, when you think about where we are today, um, it is all about AI and how do we use AI to, um, you know, really impact every single industry out there. And the foundation of that is you need to have enough AI compute. And so yes, what we announced today was a 6 gigawatt deal. It will be, you know, tens of billions of dollars of revenue uh to AMD um over the next few years. Um and it's really an opportunity for us to even partner deeper uh with, you know, the clear market leader in AI. And so, uh, you know, we're talking about building 6 gigawatts together. Um, you know, the first instantiation will actually go into place, uh, the second half of next year. Um, we see it ramping to, you know, double digit billions of revenue for us. It's incremental from an AMD standpoint. And most importantly, it actually has us working together on the technology because the technology is just super hard. There's so much we have to do to get it all working. And so bringing, you know, the best of open AI and AMD together is is what this deal is all about. Uh, a deal like this, Lisa, doesn't happen overnight. You don't wake up Sunday thinking, all right, we're going to announce this on Monday. When did you start working on it and how what was it like working with a with a Sam Altman to to get this through uh the finish line? Well, um, the key, Brian, and I've I've told you this before, the key in our uh world is it's all about roadmap. It's all about the technology. It's all about ensuring that we're meeting uh the performance capabilities for the most demanding um foundational models. And that's what OpenAI has. I mean, they have, um, you know, brilliant engineers, their models are used everywhere. And so this has been a process. It's been, you know, several years in the making. Um, it started with them testing our MI 300 and doing some early work on MI 300, uh that moved to MI 350. We've done a lot of work on software. And, you know, it's culminating in, you know, they've given us feedback on what they believe best in class is. And MI 450, which we have coming next year is absolutely that. It's best in class, you know, AI computing and, you know, the fact is, um, having a, a team that is, you know, so much at the center of the global AI AI buildout, being super excited to be a lead customer for MI 450. I think it's a great thing for us. It'll push us, uh, to get the technology out even faster. And uh, yeah, it's it's been, um, a couple, a couple of years in the making, but, um, we're super excited to be able to talk about, you know, sort of the the breadth and the depth of, uh, this relationship, you know, as it relates to our overall AI capabilities in the AI business. Lisa, I'm trying hard to make sure I got all these these terminologies down correct. So bear with me if I get one wrong. So what would deploying 6 gigawatts, how does that change the future of AI and what does that mean to the average person who's only now starting to come across AI agents on various platforms? Well, uh, Brian, it's a great question. I mean, I think we've all experimented with AI, you know, people, you know, think about chat GPT and Gemini and asking it questions. Um, but what we're seeing is this is really only the very beginning of people, uh, taking AI and using it, uh, for um, improving businesses, for improving research, for improving, um, you know, all kinds of capabilities. And what we see is, you know, to get more capability, you need more compute. So the work that we're doing is building the foundation of this AI world. And, you know, what we want is to make sure, like every time you have something that you want to use AI for, there needs to be able to have enough compute on demand. And that's why we're talking about building multiple gigawatts. I mean, it is, you know, once you build out all 6 gigawatts, I mean you're talking about millions of GPUs and that millions of GPUs will go towards every user having, you know, sort of intelligence at their fingertips. How difficult is it to build out this type of infrastructure? It's incredibly difficult. Let me say, Brian, it is incredibly difficult. Uh, but we have been working on this for years. And, you know, sort of our technology is really around the chips about ensuring that, um, you know, we are constantly looking for pushing the envelope, um, on sort of the next generation. So we're really excited about our MI 450 uh generation. It has um 2 nanometer technology, so the most advanced fabrication uh capability, it has, you know, rack scale solutions. So we're really putting all of these, um, you know, compute elements together. And the way to think about it is it takes a village to build this all. So, you know, we are, of course, very, you know, proud and focused and dedicated on our piece of it. Uh, but it's us, it's our cloud service partners, um, it's obviously open AI and the model users. We all need to come together, you know, plan this infrastructure together, make sure there's enough power in the world, uh for all of this AI compute. And once we put it all together, uh, you know, we deliver just, you know, fantastic capability to the world. Is there enough power? There is not enough, but we are actively building everywhere. I mean, this is, you know, all about uh, ensuring that there's enough power, certainly in the United States. I think there has been tremendous focus uh by this administration of ensuring that, you know, AI is top of bind and uh that's super important. Um, it's ensuring that we have enough manufacturing capacity uh to do this. It's all of the above. And so I would say that the industry is coming together. I mean, this is one of those points in time where you need every part of the, the food chain to come together and say, um, we want to do this, you know, we want to build fast, we want to build big. And uh, we're all putting our best efforts, um, you know, towards this, uh, towards this big vision. So much has happened, uh, since I last talked to you, Lisa. I mean, of course, this deal is is very much front and center. We have, uh, the US government now has a stake in Intel, which wasn't on my bingo card coming into this year. Uh, some would say these tie ups are causing risks to the AI industry or even the, the tech industry. What do you say to those critics? You know, Brian, I would say that that's probably thinking too small. Um, I mean, you have to really look at, you know, what the power of this technology can do for the world. And if you think about all of the applications that can take advantage of AI and computing and, you know, sort of the, the massive investments that will have, you know, significant returns on the other end, um, it takes time to build all this out. So yes, you know, there are, you know, we are investing heavily, some might say investing ahead of the curve. I actually say investing, um, at the right pace because we want to accelerate. You know, this is a place where when, you know, companies and and uh partners make bold moves, um, it will be rewarded because we will do things that you previously thought weren't possible. We're actually bringing the industry ecosystem together so that we're actually, you know, getting the best of each of our teams so that we can actually accelerate the rate and pace of um deployment and and AI innovation. So, you know, I really believe that this is the beginning of a, you know, 10-year kind of super cycle and we're very in the very early innings of this. Um, I think Brian, you know, I used to say that I thought the AI tam just for, you know, silicon accelerators sort of our piece of the business was going to be, you know, 500 billion dollars and some people thought, boy, that was a big number. And and now maybe I've underestimated that number and we have a lot of clear, um, you know, demand across the world, you know, for this um infrastructure."

INTC,Should Nvidia be worried about AMD's chip deal with OpenAI?,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-worried-amds-chip-deal-164500537.html,2025-10-08,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is maintaining its share gains late Monday morning afterannouncing an AI chip partnership with OpenAI(OPAI.PVT); this deal has OpenAI taking up a 10% stake in AMD. This all comes after Nvidia (NVDA) inkeda $100 billion investment into OpenAIwhile also brokering partnerships withIntel(INTC) andAlibaba(BABA). Lopez Research founder Maribel Lopez discusses what this deal could mean for AMD's inferencing technology and AI chipmaking competitor Nvidia. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Catalysts. Shares of AMD surging on the deal. It's the latest sign of activity in the AI space that comes just a week after Nvidia invested in Open AI. Joining me now, Mary Bo Lopez, Lopez Research founder who tracks the tech space. Mary Bo, what's your um, reaction to this latest news this morning and the sort of broadening of this um, open AI ecosystem? I think it's great for AMD. I think everybody's noticed that. Um, I think the thing that's really interesting about the space right now is the circular economy flow we're having. It's basically all tides are rising all the boats at the moment. They're all investing in each other. They're all committing to uh large purchases and large capital infrastructure build outs. And I think there was some hesitation in the market uh for actual dollars being spent on all this CAPEX to build these facilities. So now we're starting to see some really creative uh investment deals between the companies. So this is just the latest in that. What I think is really interesting about this is it's really actually picking up on something that not too many people have talked about and that's that enterprises are starting to move into AI. when they do that, they're looking at inferencing technology. AMD is really good right now at inferencing technology and Open AI has made an investment in that. So we've got a high end to the GPU market and a mid to the low end in the GPU market and really open AI is basically placed bets so that they can service all the demand that's going to come moving forward with a combination of Nvidia and AMD and keeping Nvidia a bit honest, I might add. Yeah, I mean, so it doesn't sound like this is necessarily negative for Nvidia then. No, absolutely not. I mean, frankly, Nvidia will continue to sell everything that they produced for the coming several years. So I'm not really worried about Nvidia. Where I think the worry comes in in the longer term picture is that um Nvidia can't just sell at the high end of the chip market. It's going to have to sell at a broader end of the stack. It's going to have to win inferencing workloads. We originally thought those inferencing workloads were going to go to Intel, then they're that became suspect. We then moved into thinking about AMD, but also we have platforms for Nvidia that are good for inferencing as well. So the question is will AMD eat into what we thought would have been that upside for Nvidia. And there's a good chance that um at least people are investing to make sure that they have a solid alternative to Nvidia on that market."
INTC,"AMD (AMD) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-amd-shares-skyrocket-know-155550203.html,2025-10-08,"Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 26.8% in the morning session after the company announced a massive, multi-year strategic partnership with OpenAI (the creator of ChatGPT) to supply its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for the AI company's next-generation infrastructure. The agreement commits OpenAI to deploying up to 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs, starting with the AMD Instinct MI450 Series. The initial rollout of one gigawatt is scheduled for the second half of 2026. This scale signifies a long-term, multi-billion-dollar revenue stream for AMD, with some analysts projecting the deal could generate tens of billions of dollars in total revenue over its lifespan. To align interests, AMD issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock. These shares are structured to vest as specific milestones are achieved, including the initial deployment and subsequent scaling up to the full 6 gigawatts. This equity position signals a deep, long-term commitment and strong belief in AMD's technology and future on the part of one of the world's most influential AI companies. For investors, this deal does three things: 1) It validates the performance and readiness of AMD's Instinct GPU line for the most demanding AI workloads; 2) It secures a massive, long-term revenue commitment from a flagship client in the AI sector; and 3) It establishes AMD as an essential player in the global AI supply chain. Is now the time to buy AMD?Access our full analysis report here. AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 22 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for AMD and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 3.6% after the company announced an expanded artificial intelligence (AI) partnership and reports surfaced of a potential manufacturing deal with rival Intel. The collaboration with enterprise AI firm Cohere involved deploying Cohere's AI models on AMD's Instinct GPU-powered infrastructure, a move aimed at competing in the enterprise and sovereign AI markets. In separate reports, it was noted that AMD was in early discussions to use Intel's foundry services for some of its chip production, which would mark a shift from its current producer, TSMC. The stock's rise was also supported by broader positive sentiment for the semiconductor sector, as strong demand for data center and AI chips lifted several major tech companies. AMD is up 75.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $211.92 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,509. Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report ona profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next."
