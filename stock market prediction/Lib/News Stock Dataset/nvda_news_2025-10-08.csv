NVDA,What's driving the latest bout of AI deals? Analyst answers.,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/whats-driving-latest-bout-ai-213000938.html,2025-10-08,"Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead and Futurum CEO Daniel Newman discuss the AI milestones that could push Big Tech companies and hyperscalers even farther, includingmeeting compute capacity and demands, amid the latest round ofartificial intelligence deals and partnerships. Also catch Daniel Newman and Patrick Moorhead weigh in onwhether bubbles are forming in the AI trade. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out moreMarket Domination. What are the kinds of milestones you're watching, Pat? Well, the the first thing you're going to see is you're going to see a cool down in spending uh on on on on CapX with the hyper scalers, or you're going to see uh some uh uh I I would say hard questions that investors are asking them. I think we have to start to see agentic frameworks that can be developed uh horizontally uh through the Microsofts, uh through the Google's, the AWS's in conjunction with, I'll call it enterprise SAS, uh where they're actually delivering higher levels of revenue and and and utility. On the consumer side, uh what I what I really want to see and what we should be concerned with is if we're not seeing increased revenue or new services based upon this. I feel pretty good, a lot more I feel better longer term than I do mid-term because I think if we get to AGI, paying that $200 per month per a lot of people on the planet, um, will deliver incredible value. What do you make of that, Dan? These companies are making a big bet on the future. The problem is people are having a really hard time bifurcating now in 5 and 10 years into the future. They are saying things like, well, we're not getting AI revenue today. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're betting on a 5 and 10-year future. The reason they're making these deals with Nebius or with an Iren, um, to get all the capacity. The reason that Sam Altman is working with AMD and working with Nvidia, wouldn't be surprised to hear an Intel announcement in the future. And the reason this is is because he knows the only way he can continue to get the growth is to make sure he has all the compute capacity required. So this energy requirement has to be built out. The compute demand, literally every GPU and custom AI chip that can be built, Josh, will be sold. So, if you look at what Pat said about the multi-year, it's not just the two years. The two years we're going to continue to see a massive chip spend. But 5 and 10 years in the future, Microsoft needs to buoy its business model. And if it doesn't have the capacity to deliver these AI experiences in 5 years, this is how the big fall. And so they're making the investment now, they're putting their strong balance sheets and they're using their operating leverage to make sure that five and 10 years into the future, they can't be disrupted."

NVDA,The stakes of OpenAI's dealmaking,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-stakes-of-openais-dealmaking-100018146.html,2025-10-08,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The Chart of the Day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings OpenAI is on a dealmaking tear. First it wasOracleandNvidia. Then, on Monday,AMD joined the OpenAI partnership party, in a multibillion-dollar collaboration with the maker of ChatGPT. Chipmaker and Nvidia rival AMD will provide upward of 6 gigawatts of GPUs to OpenAI over several years. And OpenAI will take a roughly 10% stake in the company. AMD shares soared more than 30%, underscoring how highly the market values OpenAI's ambitions and the fortune-making potential ofthe AI buildout. But OpenIA's burst of partnerships also underscores the stakes for a company going all in on superintelligence. However investors and analysts see OpenAI's leadership in AI — whether that's at the top of the pedestal or near it — one thing Sam Altman doesn't have is a profitable business that predates the recent LLM mania. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy As DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients Friday, ""If all the enthusiasm over Generative Artificial investment is going to hit a pothole soon, it will almost certainly not be because of financial results at US Big Tech firms."" The massive investments tech giants are doling out on AI are still operating within their limits of operating cash flows and commitments to shareholders, he noted. OpenAI, in other words, is vulnerable in ways its tech giant rivals are not. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. Yes, OpenAI claims the top two apps in the App Store rankings right now. That standing reflects user excitement for its new video generation tool Sora and the sustained interest in its flagship product ChatGPT. The flurry of agreements also showcasesAltman's strategic approachanda circular, incestuous style of dealmakingthat shrewdly places chipmaking rivals in the business of advancing his business. Both offensive and defensive at once, OpenAI's intertwining makes it, if not ""too big to fail,"" about as close as it could be. But for all the shrewdness and ambition, there is no fallback plan or alternative revenue stream. OpenAI doesn't have a sprawling social media network or a global advertising machine; it doesn't (yet) have a world-class hardware lineup with an ecosystem of users that exceeds a billion. There is no e-commerce platform. No cloud storage empire. Name your tech giant business unit and OpenAI doesn't have it. That's not to say that startups shouldn't bother to trailblaze a new market. But the ability of the tech giants to spend vast fortunes on their future, while maintaining profitability, is something no amount of dealmaking can manufacture. On the other hand, if AI truly succeeds as the companies and investors anticipate, we may all forget what Microsoft used to sell. After all, only a few years ago, Nvidia was a graphics card company.

Nvidia is investing as much as $2 billion in the equity portion of the deal, Bloomberg reported, adding that the financing, which includes equity and debt, will be tied to the Nvidia graphics processing units that xAI plans to use in its data center Colossus 2. XAI's financing would be split between about $7.5 billion of equity and as much as $12.5 billion of debt, and is structured through a special purpose vehicle that will be used to buy Nvidia processors, the report said. Nvidia declined to comment, while xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In September, Elon Musk denied a CNBC report that said xAI was raising $10 billion at a post-money valuation of $200 billion. Musk added that ""xAI will of course raise capital in the coming months, just not right now."" Musk launched xAI in July 2023 as an alternative toOpenAI's ChatGPT.

NVDA,Nvidia to Invest in Musk’s xAI as Part of $20 Billion Funding,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-invest-musk-xai-part-231116143.html,2025-10-08,"(Bloomberg) --The Elon Musk-backed artificial intelligence startup xAI is raising more financing than initially planned — including an equity investment from Nvidia Corp. — to bring its ongoing funding round to $20 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The financing, which includes equity and debt, will be tied to the Nvidia graphics processing units that xAI plans to use in Colossus 2, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. That’s the name of its largest data center site, which is located in Memphis. Most Read from Bloomberg The Long Comeback of the Erie Canal London’s ‘Superloop’ Buses Seek to Speed Suburban Commutes In Chicago, a Soft Architecture Biennial for Hard Times The Federal Government Shutdown Adds to DC’s Economic Woes Chicago Mayor to Unveil Budget That Addresses Trump Funding Cuts Nvidia is investing as much as $2 billion in the equity portion of the deal, the people said, a strategy by the chipmaker that helps accelerate its customers’ AI investments. XAI’s fundraising effort, previously reported by Bloomberg at half the amount, may continue to grow. A representative for Nvidia declined to comment. A spokesperson for xAI didn’t respond to a request for comment. Musk posted on X in September that the company was “not raising any capital right now.” The massive capital raise is just the latest for the AI industry, which has seen major tech companies invest tens of billions at a frenetic pace in order to build the infrastructure necessary to develop top AI models. Earlier this week, OpenAI announced a deal to use Advanced Micro Devices Inc. chips over multiple years. Meta Platforms Inc. has inked several multibillion-dollar deals in the past few months, including a $29 billion financing package for data centers. Oracle Corp. also raised a $38 billion debt package for its infrastructure. XAI’s financing would be split between about $7.5 billion of equity and as much as $12.5 billion of debt, the people said, and structured via a special purpose vehicle. The SPV will be used to buy Nvidia processors, and Musk’s artificial intelligence startup would then rent the chips out for five years, allowing Wall Street financiers to recoup their investment. The unique deal structure, with the debt backed by the GPUs as opposed to the company, could provide a playbook for tech firms looking to decrease debt exposure. Nvidia’s leaders have said they will use the company’s growing financial strength to speed up the deployment of artificial intelligence across the industry. In September, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference that Nvidia will repurchase stock and do strategic acquisitions where possible, but the priority is on using cash to help other companies use AI more quickly. Apollo Global Management is participating in the debt raise, as is Diameter Capital Partners, the people said. Valor Capital is leading the equity portion of the deal, Bloomberg previously reported. Apollo is also investing. A Diameter spokesperson declined to comment, while representatives for Apollo and Valor didn’t respond to requests for comment. Data center capacity is seen as a necessity for developing top AI models, though some have debated how much the computing power can improve the technology. In the US bond markets alone, tech companies have raised about $157 billion this year — up 70% from last year. Musk’s xAI is especially eager for capital. The firm, which already raised about $10 billion of corporate equity and debt earlier this year, still needs billions more given the company has been burning through $1 billion per month, Bloomberg reported. Musk has also tapped his empire of companies, including SpaceX, for investment into xAI. Later this year, Tesla Inc. investors will vote on whether the electric carmaker should invest in xAI as well. Musk has framed AI as the foundation for many of his futuristic products, including self-driving cars and fully autonomous robots. --With assistance from Ian King.

NVDA,"Intel to reveal tech details on forthcoming PC chip, sources say",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-reveal-tech-details-forthcoming-225159709.html,2025-10-08,"By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel (INTC) plans to release technical details about its forthcoming chip for laptops, known as Panther Lake, on Thursday, four sources briefed on the plans told Reuters. It is part of an effort to reassure investors about Intel's first product made entirely using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A, the sources said. This price reflects trading activity during the overnight session on the Blue Ocean ATS, available 8 PM to 4 AM ET, Sunday through Thursday, when regular markets are closed. The Panther Lake chips are the company's high-end mobile processors that are typically included in more expensive laptops and are the first high-volume Intel products to use the 18A process that the company has spent billions developing. In part because of manufacturing stumbles, Intel has steadily ceded laptop and PC market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices. Panther Lake represents an opportunity to reverse some of the losses. The company conducted hours of technical briefings and factory tours in Arizona for industry analysts last week on the new Panther Lake microarchitecture, including detailed explanations of the graphics and central processor cores and its media engine, according to the sources. Intel revealed a redesigned AI engine and the company's efficiency and performance processor cores, which were redesigned for the 18A manufacturing process. The last-generation laptop chip called Lunar Lake was primarily made by Intel rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel executives have said the Panther Lake chips will be available early in 2026, according to the sources. The new chips use 30% less energy than the prior generation, and its graphics and central processors will receive a 50% boost in their ability to crunch data in some situations, according to a second source briefed on the chips. The technical briefings conducted last week for a group of analysts and journalists underscored the importance of Panther Lake's success to Intel, which has struggled to manufacture the cutting-edge chips. An Intel spokesperson said the company holds technical briefings in the autumn most years on various topics but declined to comment further. In July, the chipmaker reported a second-quarter loss of $2.9 billion and disclosed that if it did not secure a customer for its planned future 14A manufacturing process, it would suspend work on it. After U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpcalled for the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan in August, Intel attracted investments from SoftBank Group andNvidia. After Tan met with Trump and other officials in the White House, the administration worked out a deal to transform a CHIPS Act grant into a 9.9% equity stake in the company. Last week, as part of the briefings, Intel conducted a tour for reporters and industry analysts of its factories in Arizona, including one called Fab 52, the people said. Intel broke ground on Fab 52 in 2021 as part of former CEO Pat Gelsinger's multibillion-dollar global expansion plan to compete with TSMC in the contract manufacturing business. Fab 52 houses Intel's 18A in-house manufacturing process, which includes a new transistor design and a method of delivering energy to the chip more efficiently. The tour aimed to demonstrate Intel's manufacturing prowess and show off the chip factory, or fab, that it will use for high-volume manufacturing of Panther Lake chips. Reuters did not attend this tour. Intel executives did not discuss the current Panther Lake yields, or the number of good chips that Intel is capable of producing, according to the people. Reuters reported in August that over the summer the Panther Lake yield was roughly 10%, up from 5% late last year. (Reporting by Max A. Cherney in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

NVDA,Top analyst ‘very concerned’ about Nvidia fueling an AI bubble and a ‘Cisco moment’ like the dotcom crash: ‘We’re a lot closer to the seventh inning than the first or second inning’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-analyst-very-concerned-nvidia-211320554.html,2025-10-08,"A top Wall Street analyst has sounded an alarm over the U.S. equity bull market, warning that its remarkable run is built on a precariously narrow foundation: a surge in spending on, and optimistic assumptions about, infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI). This spending has fueled a boom in the shares of most of the so-called Magnificent 7 and a few dozen related businesses, which have now come to account for roughly 75% of the S&P 500’s returns since the rally of the last few years began. The commentary on September 29 byMorgan StanleyWealth Management’s chief investment officer,Lisa Shalett, frames the current market boom as a “one-note narrative” almost entirely dependent on massive capital expenditures in generative AI, raising questions about its durability as economic and competitive risks start to mount. Shalett’s critique came squarely in the middle of some people in the AI field — and manyfinancial commentatorsaroundWall Street—fretting at market exuberance and beginning totalk openly about a bubble. In an interview withFortune, Shalett said she was “very concerned” about this theme in markets, saying her office had broadened from a belief that the market would only bid up seven or 10 stocks to roughly 40. “At the end of the day … this is not going to be pretty” if and when the generative AI capital expenditure story falters, she said. Shalett said she’s worried about a “Cisco moment” like when the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, referring to the company that was briefly the most valuable company in the world before an80% stock plunge. [By “Cisco moment” did she mean a whole bunch of circular financing coming back to bite the company? If so, that would be worth adding/briefly explaining.] When asked how close we are to such a moment, Shalett said probably not in the next nine months, but very possibly in the next 24. When you look at the actual spending and the amount of capital coming into the space, “we’re a lot closer to the seventh inning than the first or second inning,” she said. Shalett’s comments centered on several recent multibillion-dollar deals to scale up data-center infrastructure. As notable substacker and former Atlantic writer Derek Thompson recently noted in a post titled “This is how the AI bubble will pop,” so much money is being spent to support AI’s energy-consumption needs that it’s the equivalent of a new Apollo space mission every 10 months. (Tech companies are spending roughly $400 billion this year alone on data-center infrastructure, while the Apollo program allocated about $300 billion in today’s dollars to get to the moon from the 1960s to the ’70s.) What’s more than a little concerning to Shalett is that one company alone, Nvidia—the most valuable company in the history of the world, with an over $4.5 trillion market cap—is at the center of a significant number of these deals. In September alone, Nvidia invested$100 billion in OpenAIin a massive deal, just days after pledging$5 billion to Intel(theIntelagreement was tied to chips, not data-center infrastructure, per se). Fortune‘s Jeremy Kahn reportedin late September on significant concerns about “circular” financing, or Nvidia’s cash essentially being recycled throughout the AI industry. Shalett sees this as a major concern and a major sign that the business cycle is headed towardsome kind of endgame. “The guy at the epicenter, Nvidia, is basically starting to do what all ultimate bad actors do in the final inning, which is extending financing, they’re buying their investors.” Shalett expanded on her concerns by saying that companies around Nvidia “are starting to become interwoven.” She noted that OpenAI is partially owned byMicrosoft, but now Nvidia has also made an investment in the startup, whileOracleand AMD each have their own purchasing agreements with OpenAI. But OpenAI also has a data-center deal with tech giant Oracle, with the “bad news,” Shalett notes, that this deal is “totally debt-financed.” OpenAI also struck a deal in October with chip-maker AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD. “Essentially, Nvidia’s main competitor is going to be partially owned by OpenAI, which is partially owned by Nvidia. So, Nvidia can ‘own’ a piece of its largest competitor. It is totally circular and increases systemic risk.” When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Nvidia said, “We do not require any of the companies we invest in to use Nvidia technology.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed the OpenAI investment in an appearance on theBg2 podcastwith Brad Gerstner and Clark Tang on September 25, calling it an “opportunity to invest” and part of a partnership geared toward helping OpenAI build their own AI infrastructure. When asked about the allegation of circular financing in general and the Cisco precedent in particular, Huang talked about how OpenAI will fund the deal, arguing that it will have to be funded by OpenAI’s future revenues, or “offtake,” which he pointed out are “growing exponentially,” and by its future capital, whether it’s raised by a sale of equity or debt. That will depends on investors’ confidence in OpenAI, he said, and beyond that, it’s “their company, it’s not my business. And of course, we have to stay very close to them to make sure that we build in support of their continued growth.” Shalett said that she and her team were “starting to watch” for signs of a bubble popping, highlighting the deal announced roughly a week before OpenAI struck its $100 billion data-center deal with Nvidia, when it struckanother with Oracleworth $300 billion.Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets estimatedthat Oracle will have to borrow $100 billion of that amount—$25 billion a year for the next four years. “Every morning the opening screen on my Bloomberg is what’s going on with CDS spreads on Oracle debt,” Shalett said, referring to credit default swaps, the financial instrument that was obscure before the Great Financial Crisis, but infamous for the role it played in a global market meltdown. CDSs essentially serve as insurance to investors in case of insolvency by a market entity. “If people start getting worried about Oracle’s ability to pay,” Shalett said, “that’s gonna be an early indication to us that people are getting nervous.” She added that all the indications to her speak of the end of a cycle and history is littered with cautionary tales from such times. Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. Since the October 2022 bear market bottom and the launch of ChatGPT, according to Shalett’s calculations, the S&P 500 has soared 90%, but most of these gains have come from a small group of stocks. The so-called “Magnificent Seven”—including high-profile names likeNvidiaand Microsoft—plus another 34 AI data-center ecosystem companies, are responsible for, as cited by Shalett and separately by JP Morgan Asset Management’sMichael Cembalest, about three-quarters of overall market returns, 80% of earnings growth, and a staggering 90% of capital spending growth in the index. Comparatively, the other 493 names in the S&P 500 are up just 25%—showing just how concentrated the rally has become. The so-called “hyperscaler” companies alone are now spending close to $400 billion annually on capex supporting AI infrastructure, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management calculated. The economic influence of AI capex is now immense, contributing an estimated 100 basis points—fully one percentage point—to second-quarter GDP growth, according to Morgan Stanley’s research. This pace outstrips the rate of underlying consumer spending growth by tenfold, underscoring its centrality to both market performance and broader economic data. “People conflate AI adoption, which is in the first inning, with the capex infrastructure buildout, which has been going full-out since 2022,” Shalett toldFortune. She cited concerns about the prominence of private equity and debt capital coming into play, as that “tends to produce bubbles, because it may be unspoken-for capacity.” In other words, people have money to burn and they’re throwing it at things that may not pay off. Shalett waved away macro theories about the labor market or the Federal Reserve. “We think that’s missing the forest for the trees because the forest is entirely rooted in this one story” about AI infrastructure. Morgan Stanley’s bull-case mid-2026 price target for the S&P 500 is an eye-popping 7,200, but Shalett highlights that even the most optimistic outlook admits that risk premiums, credit spreads, and market volatility do not seem to fully account for the vulnerabilities lurking beneath the AI-fueled advance. Shalett’s analysis suggests that AI capex maturity is approaching and some possible slowdowns are already visible. For instance, hyperscalers have already seen free-cash-flow growth turn negative, a sign that investment may have outpaced underlying technology returns. Strategas, an independent research firm, estimates that hyperscaler free cash flow is set to shrink by more than 16% over the next 12 months, putting pressure on lofty valuations and forcing investors to demand more discipline in how these funds are deployed. Shalett was asked about data centers’ disproportionate impact on GDP throughout 2025, which media blogger Rusty Foster ofToday in Tabsdescribed as: “Our economy might just be three AI data centers in a trench coat.” The Morgan Stanley exec said “That’s what makes this cycle so fragile,” adding that at some point, “we’re not gonna be building any data centers for a while.” After that, it’s just a question of whether you crash: “Do you have a mild 1991-92-style recession or does it really become bad?” Bank of AmericaResearch weighed in on the semiconductors sector in a Friday note, writing that vendor financing in the space, especially Nvidia’s $100 billion commitment to OpenAI, has been “raising eyebrows.” Nevertheless, the team, led by senior analyst Vivek Arya, argued that the deal is structured by performance and competitive need, rather than pure speculative frenzy. In an interview with Fortune, Arya explained why he wasn’t worried despite the “optics” being pretty obviously bad. “It’s very easy to say, ‘Oh, Nvidia is giving [OpenAI] money and they are buying chips with that money” and so on, but he argued the headlines are misleading about how much money is actually being spent and the $100 billion sticker price on the OpenAI deal “scared everyone.” Noting that the deal has multiple tranches that will play out over several years to come, he said it’s not like Nvidia is “just handing a $100 billion check to OpenAI [and saying] you know, go have fun.” “Nvidia didn’t fund all of it,” Arya said of the wider generative AI capex boom. Citing public filings, Arya argued that Nvidia’s entire investment in the AI ecosystem is in fact less than $8 billion or so over the last 12 months, not such a large figure after all. And he’s still bullish on Nvidia and OpenAI, he added, because he sees them as the winners of this particular story. “We think they are going to be among the four or five ecosystems that come up. It’s not like Nvidia is going and investing in every one of those ecosystems, right? They’re only investing in one of those five, which is, of course, the most disruptive,” that being OpenAI. When asked about his own fears of a bubble, Arya actually sounded a calmer but strikingly similar tune to Shalett. “I’m extremely comfortable with what will happen in the next 12 months,” Arya said, “And I have high sense of optimism about what will happen in the next five years. But can there be periods of digestion in between? Yeah.” Explaining that this is the nature of any infrastructure cycle, “it’s not always up and to the right.” In other words, after the next nine months in Shalett’s opinion and the next year in Arya’s, the data-center buildout endgame could be in play. “When these data centers are built,” Arya said, “they are not built for today’s demand. They’re built with some anticipation of demand that will develop in the next, you know, 12 to 18 months. So, are they going to be 100% utilized all the time? No.” Some of the biggest names in tech and Wall Street offered were hedging hard about the possibility of a bubble on Friday. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Jeff Bezos, both speaking at a tech conference in Turin, Italy, said they were seeing the same patterns as Shalett.Solomon saidthe massive amounts of spending weren’t fundamentally different from other booms and busts. “There will be a lot of capital that was deployed that didn’t deliver returns,” he said. That’s no different from how investment works. “We just don’t know how that will play out.” Bezos characterized it as “kind of an industrial bubble,” arguing that the infrastructure would pay off for many years to come. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who got markets jittery in late August when he mentioned the B-word, wasasked again to comment on the subjectwhile touring (what else?) a giant new data center in Texas. “Between the 10 years we’ve already been operating and the many decades ahead of us, there will be booms and busts,” Altman said. “People will overinvest and lose money, and underinvest and lose a lot of revenue.” For his part, Cisco CEO John Chambers, one of the faces of the dotcom bubble,told the Associated Presson October 3 that he sees “a lot of tremendous optimism” about AI that is similar to the “irrational exuberance on a really large scale” that marked the internet age. It indicates a bubble to him, but only “a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren’t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?” When asked whether the size of this potential bubble represents uncharted waters for the economy, especially considering the one-note nature of the long bull market, Shalett said Wall Streeters are always evaluating risk. But putting on her “American citizen hat,” she warned about the media consolidation that sees Oracle’s founder Larry Ellison also now playing a major role in TikTok (as part of a buying consortium of Trump-friendly billionaires) and Paramount in Hollywood and CBS News in New York (through his son, David Ellison, the media company’s new owner). Shalett said she’s worried about “groupthink” filtering into the functioning of markets. “That is not something that most of us have experienced in our lifetimes,” she said. “You stop factoring in risk premiums into markets, there is no bear case to anything.” This story was originally featured onFortune.com"
NVDA,Wall Street analysts explain how AMD’s own stock will pay for OpenAI’s billions in chip purchases,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-analysts-explain-amd-210019915.html,2025-10-08,"After AMD and OpenAI announced anexpanded partnership on Monday, thechatterimmediately turned to the unusual way OpenAI would pay for its AMD purchases. It will use AMD’s own stock to do so. To recap: OpenAI has agreed to help AMD refine its line of Nvidia competitor chips, the Instinct GPUs, as well as to purchase and deploy 6 gigawatts of compute capacity from AMD over multiple years. AMD said this deal is worth billions in revenue. But OpenAI isn’t paying for this out of its own revenues. Instead AMD has granted OpenAI a boatload of stock warrants — up to 160 million AMD shares — which will vest in tranches as certain milestones are achieved. Those milestones include specific increases in the stock price, with the last tranche dependent on AMD shares soaring to $600 apiece,AMD disclosed. They were trading at about $165 before the news hit and soared to $214 by market close Monday after the announcement. If the stock price hits its marks, and OpenAI achieves all its required contributions, and OpenAI holds all of AMD’s shares, not selling any along the way, OpenAI may make enough on AMD stock to pay for a lot of GPUs. The stock could be worth about $100 billion. “We would note that the final 6th tranche requires ~$1T market cap to vest – ergo, if OAI were to hold stock until the end of the deal, its stake would be worth ~$100B,” writes UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri in a research note on Tuesday. But Arcuri believes that a more likely scenario is that OpenAI will sell its AMD stock along the way to pay its AMD bill. So, essentially, this is a scheme for AMD to finance this customer’s purchases. Still, Arcuri argues, the validation that AMD’s AI GPUs can handle OpenAI workloads, and ergo any other AI workloads, is valuable enough for AMD to make this financing gambit. “AMD highlighted ongoing customer dialogs beyond OpenAI and expects this agreement to ultimately accelerate AMD adoption momentum,” he writes. In particular, OpenAI’s stamp of approval gives it an in to sell its GPUs to the many cloud service providers it already provides with CPUs. So in the long run, the ones who will truly be paying for OpenAI’s giant multi-year purchase of AMD GPUs will be retail and institutional investors if they do indeed bid the stock price up. In many ways Nvidia is also financing OpenAI’s purchases of Nvidia’s wares with its own $100 billion investmentannounced last month. The difference, of course, is that Nvidia’s multiple investments in OpenAI has granted Nvidia a stake in the fast-growing AI provider, not the other way around. But what choice did AMD have? By financially engineering a deal that costs OpenAI little, it gets a significant foothold — as much as 30% market share, USB estimates — into one of thebiggest build-outsof next-generation data centers the world has ever seen. While Arcuri admits that AMD’s deal is “arguably less attractive” than Nvidia’s, “we see this as a major validation of its [AMD’s] roadmap that could snowball to other customers.”"
NVDA,Dizzying deal delirium: How the AI bubble bursts,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dizzying-deal-delirium-ai-bubble-205337503.html,2025-10-08,"So let’s get this straight: OpenAI is now taking a 10% stake in AMD, whileNvidiais investing $100 billion in OpenAI; and OpenAI also countsMicrosoftas one of its major shareholders, but Microsoft is also a major customer of AI cloud computing company CoreWeave, which is another company in which Nvidia holds a significant equity stake; and by the way, Microsoftaccountedfor almost 20% of Nvidia’s revenue on an annualized basis, as of Nvidia’s 2025 fiscal fourth quarter. In less than three years, OpenAI has gone from a parlor game to a pillar of the global economy. You cannot help but ask, “Is this like the Wild West, where anything goes to get the deal done?” One company grants a chip supplier equity for financing data-center buildouts but takes an ownership stake in another manufacturer for the eventual development of a similar product. It is hard to imagine that Jensen Huang outsmarted his equally talented cousin, the AMD CEO, Lisa Su. The lines between revenue and equity are blurring among a small group of highly influential technology companies, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Su hasdefendedAMD’s deal with OpenAI, asserting that market bears are “thinking too small.” The chief executive describes AI’s potential as sparking a new decade-long “Supercycle” that will “transform industries, from finance to healthcare and research.” We have seen this story before, back during the “cable cowboy” days. Programmers paid the distributors. Or wait—distributors paid the programmers. And of course, there are the frequent comparisons to the run-up to the dot-com bubble. When a dramatic technological change occurs, people are often unsure exactly what to do, but they frequently act as if they do confidently know the best path forward. Major players in the industry have begun to call out the AI euphoria. Just last Friday alone, three of them spoke out, hedging hard on what’s to come. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said heexpectsthere to be “a lot of capital that was deployed that [doesn’t] deliver returns.”Amazonfounder and executive chairman Jeff Bezoscalledthe current environment “kind of an industrial bubble.” Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI,warnedthat “people will overinvest and lose money” during this phase of the AI boom. At our Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute CEO Summit in June, we heard similar admonitions from over 150 top CEOs, including seasoned venture capitalists, renowned technology founders, and global partners from leading consulting firms. While the commercial outlook for AI among business leaders was enthusiastic, there were significant pockets of concern, extending beyond safety fears, to question the frenzied paths of investment. Sure, 60% of CEOs polled didn’t believe that AI hype had led to overinvestment; however, the other 40% raised significant concerns about the direction of AI exuberance, believing a correction to be imminent. Reportsestimatethat AI-related capital expenditures surpassed the U.S. consumer as the primary driver of economic growth in the first half of 2025, accounting for 1.1% of GDP growth. JP Morgan Asset Management’s Michael Cembalestnotesthat “AI-related stocks have accounted for 75% of S&P 500 returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.” More concerning, RBC’s Kelly Bogdanovapoints outthat after the massive earnings growth of 2023 and 2024, growth rates between the “Magnificent Seven” and the rest of the S&P 500 are expected to converge next year. Notably, she recognizes that “the gap between the Tech sector’s share of market cap and net income has widened significantly” since late 2022. At our June CEO Summit, David Siegel, a computer scientist and an early student of AI at MIT, and later a Co-Founder of quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, candidly advised, “[AI technologies are] transforming business … but I also believe that the current wave of AI hype continues to mix fact with speculation freely.” Siegel continued, “Rarely does anyone speak about the limitations of current AI technologies.” The renowned investor and technologist has long held these beliefs but was emboldened by the groundbreakingreport from Applesuggesting that the reasoning capabilities of AI models may not be as sophisticated as many assume. Siegel explained in simple language what the findings may mean: “AI researchers have long worried that the impressive benchmarking results [of AI models] may be due to data contamination, where the AI training data contains the answers to the problems used in benchmarking. It’s like giving a student the answers to a test before they take the exam. That would lead to exaggerations in the models’ abilities to learn and generalize.” Arecent studyfrom MIT—released after the June CEO Summit—backed Siegel’s claims. Their research revealed that 95% of the 52 organizations consideredhad achieved zero returnon investment, despite spending $30 billion to $40 billion on GenAI across more than 300 initiatives. With uncommon public candor from the consulting world, AlixPartners Co-CEO Rob Hornby, recognized among business leaders for his expertise in the technology industry, shared a similar view, telling the CEO Summit group, “I don’t think [AI models are] ready for sustaining long chains of activity in ways that displace people … AGI is just not close … I don’t think artificial intelligence and humans have that much in common, right now.” Hornby’s comments starkly contrast with the supposed reckoning of mass layoffs that the founders of leading AI companies believe will soon come to the labor force. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines recently aftertelling Axios,“AI could wipe outhalfof all entry-level white-collar jobs—and spike unemployment to 10%-20% in the next one to five years.” Another candid consulting leader, Asutosh Padhi, Senior Partner and Global Leader of Firm Strategy atMcKinsey& Company, took a more balanced view of AI in the workforce. He framed the technology as a source of enhanced productivity, not necessarily a mass replacement for people. McKinsey will continue to “hire extraordinary people, [with AI] helping them be even better at what they do,” said Padhi. Greycroft founder Alan Patricof, the venture capital pioneer with over 60 years of experience, extended a more nuanced view of AI to the investment community: “The AI revolution is a true revolution … [but] I am cautious about valuations and what people think can be accomplished in the short term … A lot of people have run into this field, and just because ‘AI’ is attached to the name, or they incorporate it into their business plan … [it] gets a lot of people excited.” Pitchbookreportedthat nearly two-thirds of deal value in the U.S. went to AI and Machine Learning startups in the first half of 2025, up from 23%in 2023. The meteoric rise can be primarily explained by the increased focus of venture organizations, such asAndreessenHorowitzandY Combinator, on AI startups and themindbogglingvaluationsof those emerging companies. Under such exuberant conditions, Patricof reflected, “There will be winners and losers, and the losses will be pretty significant.” The warnings of exuberance may be mounting, but how the bubble pops is a question that has gone unanswered. The possibilities are endless, but three stand out as having a higher likelihood of occurring. A small group of companies is securing most of the major deals. News about multibillion-dollar investments from familiar companies such as OpenAI, Nvidia, CoreWeave, Microsoft,Google, and a few others is reported almost daily. Should the bold promises of AI fall short, the dependence among these major AI players could trigger a devastating chain reaction, causing a widespread collapse similar to the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Worse yet, the ambitions are numerous and compounding, with large energy and grid infrastructure buildouts, highly advanced agentic capabilities, and widespread commercial and consumer adoption all anticipated over the next five years. Take one example. OpenAI iscommittedto investing $300 billion in computing power withOracleover the next five years, which averages $60 billion per year. Besides losing billions of dollars annually, OpenAI’s projected revenues are expected to reach $13 billion in 2025, requiring even larger amounts to cover future shortfalls. The announcement of the deal caused Oracle shares to soar by over 40%, adding nearly one-third of a trillion dollars to the company’s market value in a single day. OpenAI’s valuation hasalmost doubledfrom $300 billion to $500 billion in less than a year. Notably, recentreportingby CNBC suggests that the deal for Oracle may be costly, with the company expecting to “lose considerable sums of money” on its rental of data centers, primarily to OpenAI, and already incurring a $100 million loss in the most recent quarter. Anotherreportsays the loss may be a simple timing issue. Not long ago, Sam Bankman-Fried promised to revolutionize financial market operations with cryptocurrency exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. However, poor governance and limited regulatory oversight proved disastrous for Bankman-Fried and his backers when his fraudulent activities were exposed. Nefarious actors using Binance for money laundering shortly after the collapse of Alameda Research set the industry further back. Blockchain technologies do offer promising advances to antiquated sectors and practices, but they must be in the right hands and have the proper guardrails. AI is in a similar position to the cryptocurrency exchanges of the early 2020s, with much to offer but disparate governance practices and minimal regulatory oversight. But back then, the cryptocurrency market was still relatively small and viewed as risky by the average investor, which limited the fallout. The perceived value of AI is exponentially larger, and the potential damage from bad or even questionable actors is, therefore, much greater. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and xAI CEO Elon Musk haveeach raised concernsabout the “probability of doom” from AI misuse. Amodei estimates there is a 25% chance that AI will go “really, really badly.” Ironically, Musk’s Grok, xAI’s large language model,provided a recent exampleof what happens when tampering with the inner workings of AI models goes awry. It is notdifficult to imaginea major, publicly available AI model going rogue and inflicting significant damage to financial markets or national security systems. Such an action would require a national moratorium on comparable AI models until the damage is contained and the risk mitigated. In a powerfulWashington Postop-ed, Bethany McLeanpoignantly recallsthe overbuilding of fiber-optic cable infrastructure during the 1990s dot-com bubble. Part of the problem was due to circular financial engineering, but the other factor was due to “a [technological] breakthrough that made each line exponentially more powerful, multiplying existing capacity,” rendering much of the infrastructure unnecessary for decades. For AI, further innovation in semiconductor chip design or major advances in quantum computing, as hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure are being deployed, would immediately leave much of that investment useless in the medium to long term. That is not to say that the spare “compute” will not be needed in the future, but as McLean notes, just like the fiber-optic cable infrastructure, it could be years before those data center investments start generating a return for their backers. In the business classicExtraordinaryPopularDelusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay examined the psychology of crowd behavior and mass hysteria throughout history, from the Dutch Tulip Mania of the 1630s to humanity’s historical obsession with transmuting base metals into gold. While Mackay wrote his book in 1841, the AI mania continues to validate his conclusion: “Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, one by one.” The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs ofFortune.

NVDA,Why Power Integrations (POWI) Stock Is Falling Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-power-integrations-powi-stock-202539495.html,2025-10-08,"Shares of semiconductor designer Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) fell 3.4% in the afternoon session after the stock was caught in a broader tech sell-off sparked by concerns over the profitability of the artificial intelligence sector. The downturn followed reports that tech giant Oracle was generating lower-than-expected margins in its cloud business and losing money on renting out expensive Nvidia chips. This news caused Oracle's shares to fall and triggered wider anxiety that the massive investments required for AI might not lead to guaranteed profits. Investors grew concerned about the actual strength and financial returns of the AI boom, which had been a key driver of the market's recent performance. The uncertainty led traders to pull back from the tech sector, impacting numerous semiconductor and technology-related stocks. The shares closed the day at $37.71, down 3.4% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunties to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Power Integrations?Access our full analysis report here. Power Integrations’s shares are quite volatile and have had 19 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago when the stock dropped 7.4% on the news that the company reported weak first quarter 2025 results, its inventory levels increased and revenue was only in-line with expectations. The result revealed muted sequential growth, as sales edged up just slightly from the prior quarter despite growing 15% year-over-year. Looking ahead, revenue guidance for next quarter was just in line as well. On the other hand, Power Integrations beat analysts' adjusted operating income and EPS expectations this quarter. Still, we think this was a mixed quarter. The market seemed to be hoping for more. Power Integrations is down 37.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $37.71 per share, it is trading 44.6% below its 52-week high of $68.05 from November 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Power Integrations’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $666.61. Here at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth.

NVDA,CoreWeave’s quiet AI deal hints at a much bigger play,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-quiet-ai-deal-hints-202300747.html,2025-10-08,"CoreWeave(CRWV)continues rising up the AI ranks with aplomb. The Nvidia(NVDA)-backed cloud upstart has become one of the most closely watched “neo-cloud” players, a new breed of tech infrastructure businesses that’s tailor-made to handle AI workloads. Its purpose-built data centers are customized for training and inference, making them the go-to partner for generative-AI leaders. Nvidia’s early investment is CoreWeave’s biggest edge, giving it instant credibility and access to top-tier GPUs when supply is tight. That competitive edge has helped it land some of the biggest contracts with major AI developers to position itself as a counterweight to hyperscalers such as Amazon and Microsoft. CoreWeave has moved quickly, layering new products along with targeted acquisitions, pushing it further up the AI value chain. Now it’s adding another piece, with a massive new acquisition that expands CoreWeave’s reach into a fresh layer of applied AI. This not only broadens its customer base, but also deepens its moat. CoreWeave's latest move could potentially redefine how AI reaches the factory floor. The Nvidia-backed tech upstart just announced its acquisition ofMonolith AI, a London-based startup that looks to apply machine learning to complex physics and engineering problems. Though there’s limited information on the financial terms, the intent is crystal clear. CoreWeave is aiming to fuse its purpose-built AI cloud with Monolith’s simulation and test-driven models to create a one-stop shop platform for industrial and manufacturing customers. Related: Palantir just walked away from a billion-dollar fight That essentially means quicker design cycles, affordable testing, and fewer delays for businesses involved in building everything from cars to turbines. Monolith already has the likes ofNissan,BMW, andHoneywellas its users, helping engineers “cut months out of the product development cycle.” For CoreWeave, the acquisition is more than just a mere expansion. The AI giant has been quietly building out a portfolio, scooping upWeights & BiasesandOpenPipeearlier this year, to position itself as the operating layer for applied AI. Also, it extends its reach beyond pure compute into high-margin, applied-AI workloads. Co-founder of CoreWeave Brian Venturo said every industrial leader “knows AI can transform their business,” and Monolith “has closed that gap.” CEO Richard Ahlfeld echoed a similar sentiment, saying the deal is a chance to “scale our mission dramatically.” More tech: Goldman Sachs tweaks Nvidia's stock price target with a twist Fund manager drops bombshell call on Nvidia stock Amazon’s new Alexa feature impacts Nvidia CoreWeave’s next step will be rolling out prebuilt simulation workflows along with digital twin pilots. As we look ahead, success will hinge on swifter validation, customer trust, and keeping workloads on its platform well after pilot stages. It’s important to note that industrial AI is scaling fast. IoT Analyticsestimates that the marketwas at $43.6 billion in 2024, and is expected to surge to $153.9 billion by 2030 (23% CAGR). Similarly, an analyst from MarketsandMarkets projectsAI-in-manufacturingat $34.2 billion in 2025, rising to a whopping $155 billion by 2030 (35.3% CAGR). CoreWeave scoops up Monolith AI to spread its tentacles beyond cloud infrastructure into industrial AI applications. The move aims to develop a one-stop shop platform for manufacturers. Monolith’s customer base, including Nissan, BMW, and Honeywell,  adds credibility and immediate use-case depth. Industrial AI is projected to grow from $43.6 billion in 2024 to $153.9 billion by 2030. CoreWeave’s next leg has everything to do with building capacity, capital, and consolidation. The company guided for Q3 sales to fall inthe $1.26 to $1.30 billion range, and Q3 capex at $2.9–$3.4 billion, while keeping full-year capex at $20–$23 billion as data-center deployments grow into year-end. Liquidity looks incredible for a hyper-build. Related: Cathie Wood pours millions into a 26-year-old tech giant CoreWeave reported a whopping $2.1 billion in cash at June 30, no debt maturities until 2028, and $25 billion raised since 2024 to fuel expansion. The backlog stands at $30.1 billion, giving powerful visibility as new capacity comes online. On the demand side, the contracts keep stacking. Meta’s deal totals up to a superb $14.2 billion through 2031, while OpenAI’s commitments approach $22.4 billion, which collectively support 2025 sales guidance of $5.15 to $5.35 billion while keeping capex elevated. M&A remains central to CoreWeave’s playbook. It’s moving up the stack through its Weights & Biases and OpenPipe, and moving down through a $9 billion all-stock acquisition of Core Scientific, to secure power supply and cut costs. Management targets $500 million in annual savings by 2027. Also, the Monolith AI deal deepens CoreWeave’s reach into sticky industrial AI workloads. Additionally, since its March 28, 2025, IPO at $40, CoreWeave stock has more than tripled, surged 12% to 15% on the Meta announcement, and climbed roughly 25% through mid-September. Capex surge: $20 to $23 billion in 2025 spending as capacity grows. Strong liquidity: $2.1 billion cash, with no debt due until 2028. Deal engine: $9 billion Core Scientific bid plus Monolith, OpenPipe, and W&B. Stock momentum: Tripled since IPO, up 25% in the past two months.
